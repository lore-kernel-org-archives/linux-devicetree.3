--- Patch [5]: [PATCH v33 5/7] firmware: imx: adds miscdev ---
commit 505332d25775977b34724dbd94f2b51249b86386
Author: Pankaj Gupta <pankaj.gupta@nxp.com>
Subject: firmware: imx: adds miscdev

This commit adds the character driver for the NXP secure-enclave
communication interface. It enables userspace applications to exchange
messages with the hardware IP, managing shared memory, command validation,
and firmware status.

Closes: https://sashiko.dev/#/patchset/20260121-imx-se-if-v32-0-c5222df51cc=

[Severity: High]
Does this logic unintentionally intercept legitimate teardown responses?

During se_if_probe_cleanup(), going_away is set to 1. The teardown path then
calls cleanup_dev_ctx(), which sends graceful close commands via
se_close_storage() and se_close_session(). These commands explicitly bypass
the going_away check in ele_msg_send_rcv() so they can be sent.

However, when the hardware replies, ele_msg_rcv() checks going_away and
misidentifies the genuine wakeup as the forced unbind abort, failing the
close operation and leaking the DMA memory.

[Severity: Critical]
Could this lead to a deadlock during unbind?

When an IOCTL calls ele_msg_send_rcv(), it holds se_if_cmd_lock across the
blocking wait in ele_msg_rcv(). If the device unbinds concurrently,
se_if_probe_cleanup() attempts to acquire the exact same se_if_cmd_lock
before executing complete_all() to wake up the IOCTL thread.

The unbind thread would block waiting for the lock, while the IOCTL thread
won't release it until it is woken up.

[Severity: High]
What happens if userspace sends multiple ELE_SESSION_OPEN_REQ or
ELE_STORAGE_OPEN_REQ ioctls on the same file descriptor?

The new handle is directly assigned to dev_ctx->sess_hdl, overwriting any
previous handle without closing it. Does this allow unprivileged userspace
programs to exhaust firmware resources by leaking previous handles?

[Severity: High]
Is it safe to unconditionally read rx_msg->data[1] here?

The rx_msg buffer is allocated using kzalloc based on the user-provided
rx_buf_sz in se_ioctl_cmd_snd_rcv_rsp_handler(). If userspace provides an
8-byte buffer size and the firmware responds with a truncated payload,
would this read past the end of the allocation and leak adjacent kernel
memory?

[Severity: High]
Are there concerns with mixing goto-based error handling and scope-based
cleanup here?

The cleanup subsystem guidelines advise against using goto labels (like
goto exit) in the same function as __free annotations, as it can create
confusing ownership semantics and lead to double-free or resource leak bugs.
The same pattern is present in se_close_storage(). Would returning
directly be preferable?
