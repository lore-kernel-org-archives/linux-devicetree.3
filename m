Yeah, to bindings/mfd or bindings/soc/<vendor>. Which I think is mostly
a judgement call. Two of your devices have at least three functions,
which I think is enough to make the claim that it's not just a clock
controller.

If you have syscon in the compatible, then I think it should be syscon
in the node name as it's more general and makes it clear the device
isn't just a clock controller.

If you don't need child nodes in dt, you don't need simple-mfd.
Whether setting of_compatible is a correct thing to do, I do not know,
sorry.

If it is a miscellaneous system register region, then it should be a
syscon. These devices that perform multiple functions like hwspinlock,
clocks and resets fit that bill. Whether or not you "need" it for linux to
work, if it is a correct description of your hardware you need to use
that compatible.

Correct. The other reason for doing it the devicetree way is if there
are conflicting property requirements. E.g. two of the same class of
device, like a pair of pin control functions or devices that use
different #address-cells to one another.
