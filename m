--- Patch [5]: [PATCH v8 05/19] dmaengine: ti: k3-udma: move descriptor man=
agement to k3-udma-common.c ---
commit 2f5a11e37f11d6bdbc83b58ccea07da9ab136d47
Author: Sai Sree Kartheek Adivi <s-adivi@ti.com>

dmaengine: ti: k3-udma: move descriptor management to k3-udma-common.c

Refactor the K3 UDMA driver by moving all DMA descriptor handling
functions from k3-udma.c to a new common library, k3-udma-common.c.
This prepares the driver for supporting new K3 UDMA v2 variant.
No functional changes intended.

[Severity: Critical]
This is a pre-existing issue, but are the arguments to
cppi5_trdesc_calc_size() swapped here?

The function signature expects the count first and then the size, but it
is called with tr_size as the first argument.

When processing a scatterlist with a large number of segments where the
count exceeds the size, could this result in an under-allocation and
a subsequent heap buffer overflow?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but what happens if a consumer
submits a zero-length scatterlist?

If sglen is 0, the tr_idx variable remains 0. Does this result in a
write to tr_req[-1], causing an out-of-bounds access and corrupting
the descriptor header?

> +	cppi5_hdesc_set_pktlen(h_desc, d->residue);

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but similar to the above, if a consumer
provides a zero-length scatterlist, the flexible array hwdesc is
allocated with zero elements.

Since the code unconditionally accesses the first element of the flexible
array to retrieve h_desc, could this lead to an out-of-bounds pointer
dereference and memory corruption?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but it looks like the global
channel state is being modified without holding the vc.lock.

If a consumer prepares multiple descriptors concurrently with different
flags, could the last prepared descriptor overwrite the channel state?

When udma_is_desc_really_done() checks the flags later, this might cause
it to skip the stall check and falsely complete the transfer while data
remains in the DMA fabric.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but similar to the tx_flags modification,
this global channel state is being updated without holding any lock.

Can this lead to the same race conditions and data corruption if
concurrently modified?

I also noticed a few other pre-existing issues in the surrounding
driver code that might be worth looking into while refactoring.

[Severity: High]
In drivers/dma/ti/k3-udma.c, there appears to be a race condition between
udma_free_chan_resources() and the teardown IRQ handler:

udma_free_chan_resources() {
    ...
    udma_terminate_all(chan);
    if (uc->terminated_desc) {
        udma_reset_chan(uc, false);
        udma_reset_rings(uc);
    }
}

The udma_reset_rings() function checks for uc->terminated_desc and frees
it without holding the lock.

If udma_terminate_all() triggers a hardware teardown completion message,
and the IRQ handler concurrently takes the lock and frees the descriptor,
do both threads end up freeing the same terminated_desc, leading to a
double free?

[Severity: High]
Also in drivers/dma/ti/k3-udma.c, the platform_driver definition lacks
a remove callback:

static struct platform_driver udma_driver =3D {
    .driver =3D {
        .name =3D "ti-k3-udma",
        .of_match_table =3D udma_of_match,
        .suppress_bind_attrs =3D true,
    },
    .probe =3D udma_probe,
};

Because this is a tristate module, if the driver is unloaded via rmmod,
the registrations from udma_probe() are not symmetrically torn down.

Since devres will free the memory while the DMA engine subsystem retains
pointers to it, could this cause a use-after-free upon the next DMA access?
