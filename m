Ok. Thanks. Then I will give it a try.

I did some more research on that module and it features a Lattice FPGA
(LCMXO3LF-1300E) which to all of my measurement intercepts the I2C bus
as expected.

As it additionally manages the regulators my approach would be to
implement a Multi-Function Devices (MFD) driver for it.

The resulting DTS layout would then be something like:

&i2c1 {
	fpga@10 {
		compatible = "visioncomponents,vc-mipi-controller";
		reg = <0x10>;

		i2c-mux {
			compatible = "visioncomponents,vc-mipi-i2c-mux";

			i2c@0 {
				reg = <0>;

				ov9282: camera-sensor@60 {
					compatible = "ovti,ov9282";
					reg = <0x60>;
					...
				};
			};
		};

		vc_mipi_reg: regulator {
			compatible = "visioncomponents,vc-mipi-regulator";
		};
	};
};

Mark, Laurent, if that's incorrect or otherwise not acceptable,
please reach out. Thanks a lot!
