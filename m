firmware: imx: adds miscdev

This commit adds a character driver to communicate with NXP secure enclave
hardware IPs such as the EdgeLock Enclave. It supports shared memory
management, IO buffer allocation, and sending commands/responses via an
ioctl-based ABI.

[Severity: High]
If a fatal signal interrupts the wait here, rx_msg is cleared to NULL.
In se_ioctl_cmd_snd_rcv_rsp_handler(), this causes rsp_sz to evaluate to 0,
which bypasses the fw_api_specific_ops() call entirely.

Could this lead to a firmware resource leak if ELE_SESSION_OPEN_REQ or
ELE_STORAGE_OPEN_REQ allocated a new handle that never gets recorded for
teardown?

[Severity: High]
By overriding a successful response size with -ERESTARTSYS, the ioctl
handler translates the error to -EINTR and aborts without copying data to
userspace.

For stateful commands like key generation, wouldn't the enclave successfully
allocate the resource, but the handle is then discarded by the kernel and
never delivered to userspace?

[Severity: High]
The modify_lock is dropped immediately after checking the command receiver
status, before the command is sent and set_dev_ctx_as_command_receiver()
is called.

Could two concurrent ioctls from different processes pass this check? If
the second process fails registration in fw_api_specific_ops() but returns
success to userspace, its storage handle remains open in the enclave, which
might then route its NVM traffic to the first process.

[Severity: High]
The fifth argument to se_fill_cmd_msg_hdr() is defined as bool is_base_api.

Since fw_api_ver is an integer, passing it here evaluates to true. Does this
cause the header to be incorrectly formatted with base_api_ver, leading the
firmware to reject the close command and leak the session handle?

[Severity: High]
If devm_mutex_init() fails here, it returns early and bypasses the
devm_add_action_or_reset() call that sets up se_if_probe_cleanup.

Because priv was manually allocated with kzalloc_obj() and the dev reference
was bumped via get_device(priv->dev), wouldn't this early return permanently
leak the memory and leave the struct device reference unbalanced?

[Severity: Medium]
During unbind timeouts, se_if_probe_cleanup() iterates through contexts and
calls cleanup_dev_ctx(), which unconditionally frees and nullifies
dev_ctx->devname.

When se_clear_fw_busy() executes shortly after, wouldn't this printk
formatting dereference a NULL dev_ctx->devname?

[Severity: High]
The fops_lock is dropped before waiting on ele_msg_rcv(). If the wait
aborts due to an unbind and lands in this error path, it accesses
dev_ctx->devname outside the lock.

Could a concurrent cleanup_dev_ctx() free dev_ctx->devname during this
window, causing a use-after-free during printk formatting?

[Severity: High]
The rx_msg buffer is allocated using the userspace-supplied rx_buf_sz.

If userspace passes a very small rx_buf_sz (e.g. 4 bytes), but the firmware
returns a larger header size, could using rx_msg->header.size << 2 here
lead to an out-of-bounds read inside se_val_rsp_hdr_n_status()?
