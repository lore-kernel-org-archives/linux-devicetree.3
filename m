drm/microchip: add a driver for the Microchip GFX2D GPU

This commit introduces a new DRM driver for the Microchip GFX2D GPU.
It supports basic 2D graphics instructions like FILL, COPY, BLEND, and ROP
by queuing commands into a ring buffer.

[Severity: High]
Is there a missing bounds check for the ROP4 mask buffer here?

When the mask handle is resolved to a GEM object, its dimensions are not
validated against the operation size.

Later in mchp_gfx2d_clip_rect(), the drawing rectangle is intersected with
the target and source buffers, but the bounds of the mask buffer are ignore=
d.

Since the mask's physical DMA address is pushed to the GPU, a small mask
buffer alongside large target/source buffers could cause the GPU to perform
an out-of-bounds DMA read from physical memory.

Could this lead to hardware faults or leak adjacent physical memory content=
s?

[Severity: High]
Could this lockless assignment of command IDs cause a permanent deadlock?

In mchp_gfx2d_submit(), cmd->id is assigned via atomic_fetch_inc() before
priv->cmdlist_mutex is acquired. Concurrent submissions could acquire IDs
out of order.

For example, Thread A gets ID 5 and Thread B gets ID 6. They could queue
them into running_cmdlist and the hardware ring buffer in the reverse order
if Thread B acquires the lock first.

Since the GPU executes them in ring buffer order, it would write these IDs
to the completion mailbox. When mchp_gfx2d_process_completed_commands()
checks completion, it relies on a monotonically increasing mailbox value.

If the mailbox has already been overwritten with 5, the completion check for
command 6 evaluates to false, permanently stalling the command queue.

[Severity: Medium]
Does holding gfx2d_obj->mutex while sleeping break the non-blocking wait
semantics?

This function acquires the mutex and then calls mchp_gfx2d_gem_wait(),
which sleeps in wait_event_interruptible_timeout().

If another thread calls the WAIT ioctl on the same object with the
DRM_MCHP_GFX2D_WAIT_NONBLOCK flag, it will block on the mutex lock instead
of returning immediately.

It seems the mutex should only protect the w_node list manipulation and be
released before sleeping.

[Severity: High]
Can this lockless read of GFX2D_IS cause spurious interrupts?

Because GFX2D_IS appears to be a clear-on-read hardware register, reading it
here from process context clears pending interrupts.

If an interrupt is raised by the hardware and latched by the interrupt
controller, but this function reads GFX2D_IS before the primary IRQ handler
executes, the IRQ handler will read 0 and return IRQ_NONE.

Repeated IRQ_NONE returns can trigger the kernel's spurious interrupt
detector to permanently disable the IRQ line.

[Severity: Low]
Does this code fail to compile?

The macro kzalloc_obj() is not defined anywhere in the kernel or the driver,
which will lead to an immediate compile-time failure.

[Severity: High]
Is it safe to ignore the return value of pm_runtime_resume_and_get() here?

If the device is undergoing system suspend and it fails, it returns a
negative error and does not increment the PM usage counter. Proceeding to
access the hardware registers could trigger a bus fault if the peripheral
clock is off.

[Severity: High]
Furthermore, unconditionally calling pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() at the end
will drop a reference that was never acquired if the resume failed, causing=
 a
PM usage counter underflow.

[Severity: High]
Are there two race conditions in this teardown sequence?

First, the driver does not use drm_dev_enter() and drm_dev_exit() to
serialize its ioctls against device unbinding.

While drm_dev_unregister() prevents new opens, it does not wait for actively
executing ioctls to finish. A concurrently executing ioctl could access core
resources (like the command cache) after they are destroyed in
mchp_gfx2d_cleanup_command_queue(), leading to a use-after-free.

Second, mchp_gfx2d_disable_irq() clears the software flag
(priv->irq_active =3D false) before the hardware interrupt is actually disa=
bled.

Since pm_runtime_resume_and_get() can sleep in between, if the GPU asserts a
level-triggered interrupt during this window, the hardirq handler will see
priv->irq_active as false and return IRQ_NONE without clearing the interrupt
source.

Could this lock up the CPU in an infinite IRQ storm?

Similar to the issue in mchp_gfx2d_open(), does this code fail to compile?

The macro kzalloc_obj() is not defined anywhere in the kernel or the driver,
which will lead to an immediate compile-time failure.

[Severity: High]
Could an unvalidated tv_nsec value cause a CPU stall here?

This function takes timeout->tv_nsec directly from userspace without
validating that it is less than NSEC_PER_SEC. It passes this value to
timespec64_sub(), which normalizes the time using a while loop.

A malicious user could provide an extremely large value, causing the kernel
to loop billions of times and stall the CPU, triggering a soft lockup.

[Severity: Medium]
Is there a race condition if a concurrent thread guesses or receives this
GEM handle?

The handle is created and exposed to userspace by
mchp_gfx2d_gem_create_with_handle() before the driver-specific properties
like width, height, stride, and format are assigned.

If a concurrent SUBMIT ioctl uses this handle immediately, it could read
uninitialized properties, potentially causing the GPU to execute with
incorrect parameters.

[Severity: High]
Does this call to flush_cache_mm() cause a module link failure on ARM?

Because flush_cache_mm() is an architecture-specific internal API, it is not
exported to modules via EXPORT_SYMBOL on ARM configurations with VIPT caches
enabled. Compiling this driver as a module will result in an undefined
reference error.

Also, synchronously flushing the entire process address space cache from a
driver ioctl is an architectural violation and can lead to severe
performance degradation.
