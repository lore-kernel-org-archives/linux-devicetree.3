Thank you for your contribution! Sashiko AI review found 6 potential issue(=
s) to consider:

Pre-existing issues:
- [High] Failure to clear the global `rdev` pointer on an error path leads =
to an error pointer dereference on subsequent probe attempts.
- [High] Removing and re-probing cores out of order will corrupt the state =
of active cores and leak resources due to flawed `rdev->num_cores` indexing.
- [High] Resources allocated using `devm_*` APIs on the global dummy `drm_d=
ev` are permanently leaked when cores are unbound or when initialization fa=
ils.
- [High] The global `rdev` pointer and `rdev->num_cores` state are accessed=
 and modified without synchronization during concurrent probes.
- [High] The DRM device is exposed to userspace before core initialization =
completes, leading to a NULL pointer dereference on early open().
- [High] Asynchronous tasks and IRQs are not canceled/disabled before destr=
oying the DRM scheduler.

accel/rocket: select the per-core clock and reset counts from match data

This patch updates the RKNN block driver to read clock and reset counts from
per-SoC match data instead of using compile-time constants. This accommodat=
es
SoCs like the RK3576 which have different hardware requirements than the RK=
3588.
The arrays sizing logic is also updated to use the dynamically provided cou=
nts.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but if rocket_device_init() fails
during the first core's probe, it returns an error pointer which is assigned
to the global rdev pointer:

drivers/accel/rocket/rocket_drv.c:rocket_probe() {
  ...
  if (IS_ERR(rdev)) {
    dev_err(&pdev->dev, "failed to initialize rocket device\n");
    return PTR_ERR(rdev);
  }
  ...
}

Could a subsequent probe attempt bypass the rdev =3D=3D NULL check and dere=
ference
the error pointer when accessing rdev->num_cores?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but do devm_* resources allocated on the glob=
al
dummy drm_dev leak when cores are unbound?

drivers/accel/rocket/rocket_device.c:rocket_device_init() {
  ...
  rdev =3D devm_drm_dev_alloc(dev, rocket_drm_driver, struct rocket_device,
                            ddev);
  ...
}

When all cores are unbound, rocket_device_fini() unregisters the DRM device
and sets the global rdev to NULL. Since the global drm_dev is never destroy=
ed,
does this permanently leak the struct rocket_device, core arrays, and mutex=
es?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but are the global rdev pointer and
rdev->num_cores state protected against concurrent probes?

If multiple RKNN cores are probed concurrently via sysfs bind, could multip=
le
threads observe rdev =3D=3D NULL simultaneously, leading to multiple
initializations of the DRM device and races when modifying the cores array?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but is the DRM device exposed to
userspace before core initialization completes?

rocket_device_init() registers the DRM device via drm_dev_register(), making
it visible to userspace. If userspace opens the device immediately:

drivers/accel/rocket/rocket_drv.c:rocket_open() {
  ...
  rocket_priv->domain =3D rocket_iommu_domain_create(rdev->cores[0].dev);
  ...
}

Could this lead to a NULL pointer dereference in iommu_paging_domain_alloc()
since rocket_probe() hasn't populated rdev->cores[0].dev yet?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does using rdev->num_cores as an array
index corrupt the state of active cores when devices are removed and
re-probed out of order?

If core 0 is unbound via sysfs, rocket_remove() decrements rdev->num_cores
without shifting the rdev->cores[] array:

drivers/accel/rocket/rocket_drv.c:rocket_remove() {
  ...
  rdev->num_cores--;
  ...
}

A subsequent unbind of core 1 would fail because find_core_for_dev() shrinks
its search bounds to the new num_cores. If a new core is then probed, it us=
es
the decremented num_cores as the index:

drivers/accel/rocket/rocket_drv.c:rocket_probe() {
  ...
  unsigned int core =3D rdev->num_cores;
  ...
  rdev->cores[core].rdev =3D rdev;
  ...
}

Would this overwrite the active state of core 1?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but are asynchronous tasks and IRQs canceled
before destroying the DRM scheduler?

In rocket_job_fini(), drm_sched_fini() is called to tear down the DRM
scheduler before canceling the background work:

drivers/accel/rocket/rocket_job.c:rocket_job_fini() {
  ...
  drm_sched_fini(&core->sched);
   =20
  cancel_work_sync(&core->reset.work);
  destroy_workqueue(core->reset.wq);
  ...
}

If the background reset.work executes concurrently, it calls
rocket_reset_work() which issues drm_sched_start() on a scheduler that is
already destroyed. Could this lead to a use-after-free or list corruption?
