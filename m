Tbh. I don't know. The VC MIPI Camera Module Hardware Operating manual
suggests both, the controller and the sensor sit on the same I2C bus:

https://www.mipi-modules.com/fileadmin/external/documentation/hardware/VC_MIPI_Camera_Module/index.html#mipi-sensor-module-circuit

But that's just a block diagram and nothing is written down really.

I tried some reverse-engineering and probed most of the accessible pads
of the camera module with my scope. I found no evidence that there is "a
second I2C bus" with "delayed" signals as I would suspect if the FPGA
really intercepts the I2C traffic.

Nonetheless this is by far no proof that this isn't the case, as the I2C
lanes of the imaging sensor are not accessible without destroying the PCB
:-(

So any help/feedback/information is greatly appreciated.


@Mark: I understood that if the fpga really intercepts the I2C bus, it
should be modelled accordingly in device tree. But what would be the
preferred implementation if both devices sit on the same I2C bus, but
one is messing up some register reads on purpose?
