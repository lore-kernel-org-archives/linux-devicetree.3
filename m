This register space controls core devices: PLLs, the AHB bus, a lot of
timers, the USB controller, the Cortex M0 processor that boots the board
and a few other devices. For some reason the LTE coprocessor is also
partially controlled by it. The main application processor and DDR
memory are not found here though.

The register to reboot the board is found here, as well as a register to
control of watchdog expiries cause a board reset.

Version 7:

The register at top+0x140 contains a series of gates that control PLL
input into the top controller and PLL and osc26m work clock forward into
matrix. This allowed further insight into the clock tree.

The PLL subdivision list was replaced with fixed factor clocks that
divide PLLs before and after the input gate (and some fixed factor divs
go into matrix in the next patch). The number of clocks exported to
Matrix is actually relatively small.

As for Sashiko's suggestion about out of bound parents for dpll and
unknownpll: I have never seen a parent != 0. If that happens on a device
I want to know about it. At this stage of development I'd rather have
clearly visible orphaned clock than silently continuing at an unexpected
frequency.

"osc26m" -> "clock-26m" as "oscXX", although widespread, is deprecated.
In doing so, change underscores in clock names to dashes (Sashiko).

Version 5:

*) Make it a MFD child driver instead of binding to the node directly
*) Correct parents for dpll
*) Correct HSIC work clock parent

+/* Top and matrix clocks are chaotic - I haven't found a consistent pattern behind their register
+ * and bit locations. Generally there are two gates (pclk, wclk), one mux, two resets and sometimes
+ * one divider, but exceptions apply. For some devices there is only a reset and some general
+ * (parent) clocks need setup. This structure plus macro handles the somewhat regular parts.
+ *
+ * There are some patterns that can be observed.
+ * mux 0x3c, div 0x48, gate 0x54
+ * mux 0x40, div 0x4c, gate 0x5c
+ * mux 0x44, div 0x50, gate 0x60
+ *
+ * For a 0 - 0xc - 0x18 pattern. Muxes from 0x3c to 0x44, dividers from 0x48 to 0x50, gates 0x54 to
+ * 0x60. The pattern is broken for timer t17 though.
+ *
+ * Gates have 4 bits per clock - bit 0 for wclk, bit 1 for pclk, bit 2 for something the ZTE kernel
+ * calls "gate" (the bits we use here are called "en"), which presumably enables automatic clock
+ * gating. Bit 3, if settable, seems unused. E.g. offset 0x54 accepts all bits in 0xF77F7F7F -
+ * suggesting RTC, I2C0 have an extra gate bit.
+ *
+ * The default mpll settings multiply the 26 MHz reference clock times 24. A mux selection of 26 MHz
+ * could mean using the 26 MHz oscillator directly, or passing it through the PLL and divide by 24.
+ *
+ * If a UART is set to mpll-d6 (default 104 MHz), changing the mpll multipliers does affect UART
+ * timing as it should. This does not happen when the UART is set to 26 MHz input or timers that
+ * read 26 MHz input. This suggests 26 MHz clocks use the reference clock directly.
+ *
+ * The geneneral clock flow on this board goes from clock-26m into the PLLs. The PLL output is
+ * branched into a small number of divided frequencies (mpll, mpll-d4, mpll-d5, mpll-d6, mpll-d8,
+ * gpll, gpll-d2, gpll-d4) at a high level. These divided frequencies as well as clock-26m go
+ * through a series of gates at offset 0x140 in topcrm. The output of these gates provide wclks for
+ * everything.
+ *
+ * At least 3 of those gate outputs (mpll, dpll, gpll-d2) are further divided behind those gates,
+ * presumably in the matrix controller. There are multiple paths how 104 and 78 MHz are derived,
+ * some specific to topcrm (0x140 bits 1 and 4), some specific to matrix (0x140 bit 9). There are
+ * likely 3 "copies" of the 78 MHz clock and two 50 MHz ones.
+ *
+ * Pclk is not gated by the 0x140 gates at all. Likewise clock-32k is fed to the timers without
+ * passing through this gate, even for consumers on matrix/LSP. Topcrm clock-26m wclks are not gated
+ * either, but top-consumed PLL clocks are.
