drm/vc4: Use the reset controller to recover from a GPU hang

vc4_reset() recovers a hung GPU by dropping the runtime PM usage count to
zero so that the power domain goes down, and then taking it again. Such an
unconventional approach only works if the driver knows exactly how many
references it holds, which is why vc4 wrapped every pm_runtime_get_sync()
call in a private refcount and mutex.

Commit 670c672608a1 ("soc: bcm: bcm2835-pm: Add support for power domains
under a new binding.") exposed a V3D reset line for exactly this reason,
so that the block can be reset without power-cycling its domain, but the
vc4 driver never picked it up. Use it now, which removes the need for the
private refcount and leaves vc4_v3d_pm_get/put() as plain runtime PM
wrappers.

The reset line is optional, to accommodate older device trees. Device
trees that do not describe one still get the driver-side recovery in
vc4_irq_reset(), but the hardware is left untouched. Two in-tree platforms
use the VC4 V3D block: BCM2835 gains the resets property in the next
commit, and Cygnus is no worse off than it was, as its V3D node has no
power domain and the power-cycle only ever gated its clock.

[Severity: Critical]
Does removing the fallback GPU power-cycle reset mechanism break GPU hang
recovery and introduce a DMA use-after-free regression on older device
trees lacking a reset line?

If the device tree lacks a reset line, vc4_reset() skips resetting the
hardware since v3d->reset is NULL, but still proceeds to call
vc4_irq_reset().

This cancels the active software jobs, unreferences their buffer objects,
and frees the backing memory in vc4_irq_reset() and vc4_cancel_bin_job().
Because the GPU hardware was not actually stopped or reset, it
asynchronously continues executing the hanging command stream and performs
DMA reads/writes into the newly freed memory pages.

Could this memory corruption be triggered by any unprivileged user that
submits a hanging shader?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but is there a use-after-free regression
because the hangcheck timer and associated work items are never canceled
during device teardown?

In vc4_gem_init(), the driver initializes the hangcheck.timer,
hangcheck.reset_work, and job_done_work.

However, neither vc4_gem_destroy() nor vc4_irq_disable() appears to
cancel these asynchronous workers using del_timer_sync() or
cancel_work_sync().

If the driver is unloaded or unbound while a hangcheck timer is pending
or work is scheduled, will the callbacks fire after the vc4_dev memory
has been freed, leading to a kernel panic?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does requesting exclusive resources using
devm_ APIs inside a component bind callback cause re-bind operations to
fail with -EBUSY?

The vc4_v3d_bind() function uses devm_ APIs attached to the component's
device (pdev->dev). When the component unbinds, these resources are not
freed because the platform device itself is not removed.

If the DRM master defers probing and retries, or is unbound and rebound,
vc4_v3d_bind() is called again. Does the second attempt to acquire
exclusive resources like the reset control fail with -EBUSY, permanently
breaking V3D initialization?
