dmaengine: atcdmac300: Add driver for Andes ATCDMAC300 DMA controller

This patch adds support for the Andes ATCDMAC300 DMA controller.
The ATCDMAC300 is a memory-to-memory and peripheral DMA controller
that provides scatter-gather, cyclic, and slave transfer capabilities.

[Severity: High]
Does this code leave desc_node uninitialized?

dma_pool_zalloc zeroes out the descriptor, leaving the pointers for desc_no=
de
as NULL since INIT_LIST_HEAD is not called for it. If a subsequent descript=
or
allocation fails (for instance, in atcdmac_prep_device_sg), the error path
calls atcdmac_put_desc on the first descriptor.

This descends into atcdmac_put_desc_nolock, which performs list_del_init on
desc_node, potentially causing a NULL pointer dereference on the
uninitialized list head.

[Severity: High]
Can this trigger a NULL pointer dereference as described above?

[Severity: High]
Could this dereference an invalid pointer if the active_list is empty?

The channel-wide cyclic flag is sticky and is never cleared when a transfer
is terminated. If atcdmac_start_next_trans is called (for example, during
system resume) on a previously cyclic channel that is now idle, active_list
will be empty.

Using list_first_entry via atcdmac_get_active_head on an empty list returns
a bogus pointer, leading to a fault when dma_desc->at is accessed.

[Severity: Critical]
Is there a use-after-free race here if atcdmac_terminate_all runs
concurrently?

dma_desc remains in the unlocked active_list while the channel lock is drop=
ped
to invoke the client callback. If another thread calls atcdmac_terminate_al=
l,
it will splice active_list, abort the channel, manually run the callback on
dma_desc again, and return it to the free_list.

Another CPU can then immediately reallocate the descriptor and overwrite the
callback pointers while the first CPU is still reading them to execute, whi=
ch
could lead to arbitrary code execution.

[Severity: High]
Can this delayed threaded IRQ cause a double-start race with system resume?

If a transfer finishes right before suspend, the hardware interrupt fires
but the threaded IRQ handler may not execute before the system freezes. On
resume, stop_mask is cleared and the transfer is restarted. When normal
operations resume, this delayed threaded IRQ runs, finds stop cleared, and
erroneously double-starts the transfer while it is already actively running.

[Severity: High]
Does masking hardware interrupts with the software used_chan state risk an
unacknowledged IRQ storm?

If an interrupt fires for a channel where the software used_chan bit is 0
(such as an abort interrupt triggered by atcdmac_terminate_all on an idle
channel), int_ch evaluates to 0.

The handler bypasses the clear routine and returns without acknowledging the
hardware interrupt, potentially causing an infinite loop of interrupts.

> +		spin_lock(&dmac->lock);

[Severity: High]
Is it safe to use a standard spinlock_t in hardirq context here?

On PREEMPT_RT kernels, spinlock_t is implemented as an RT mutex which can
sleep. Locks acquired in genuine hardware interrupt context typically need
to be typed as raw_spinlock_t to avoid scheduling while atomic.

> +		spin_unlock(&dmac->lock);
> +		regmap_write(dmac->regmap, REG_INT_STA, DMA_INT_CLR(int_ch));

[Severity: Medium]
Does writing a blanket clear mask erase unhandled interrupts?

The DMA_INT_CLR macro writes 1s to the TC, ABT, and ERR bits for the given
channel, regardless of which interrupts were actually set in the status rea=
d.
If a new interrupt (like ERR) asserts after the status read but before this
clear write, it gets cleared but never handled.

[Severity: High]
Can this cause a soft lockup by polling for up to 100ms with interrupts
disabled?

Calling regmap_read_poll_timeout_atomic with a 100,000us timeout while
holding a spinlock in hardirq-disabled context can trigger the NMI watchdog
and create extreme system latency spikes.

> +		atcdmac_run_tx_complete_actions(desc_cur, DMA_TRANS_ABORTED);

[Severity: High]
Is it permissible to invoke completion callbacks for aborted transfers?

The dmaengine API explicitly prohibits executing callbacks for aborted
descriptors because clients (such as ALSA) typically call terminate_all with
their own stream locks held. Invoking the callback here can cause a deadlock
when the client attempts to acquire the exact same lock.

[Severity: High]
Are the DMA channels exposed to clients before the IRQ handler and cache
coherency (IOCP) are fully initialized?

dma_async_device_register makes the DMA channels immediately available to
kernel clients. If a client immediately requests a channel and starts a
transfer before atcdmac_init_irq and atcdmac_init_iocp execute, the transfer
will run without cache snooping configured, which could lead to memory
corruption.

[Severity: High]
Could this improperly restart idle cyclic channels?

This unconditionally calls atcdmac_start_next_trans for every channel
regardless of its active software state. If a channel was previously cyclic
but is currently idle, it will cause a fault as described earlier when
dereferencing the empty active_list.

[Severity: High]
Will system suspend time out and fail if a slave DMA channel is actively
waiting for peripheral data?

The suspend sequence sets a stop_mask that prevents software from chaining =
the
next descriptor, but does not pause actively running transfers. It then blo=
cks
waiting for all channels to report idle.

If a DEV_TO_MEM slave channel is waiting for hardware flow control or
incoming data, it will never complete. The polling loop will eventually time
out, aborting the entire system sleep transition.
