My bad, I didn't remember all the context correct earlier today. The
cells property is not for the SCMI sensor itself, it is for the
consumer of this node which currently is only thermal subsystem.

Not really, see my update above.

Not required for above mentioned reason.

No where, I got confused earlier as mentioned above. It is not needed
unless you have use case. Please present if you have one.

Indeed, this made me recall all the details. Sorry I hadn't looked at
or touch this code in ages.

We could add new property if needed though we can specify it would be
mutually exclusive on systems that use #thermal-sensor-cells as it is
simply useless duplication of same information as it has to be 1.
