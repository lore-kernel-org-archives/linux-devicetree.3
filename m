Apologies, I guess your email with the bootloader case came while I was
composing, hence missed it.

Anyway, that is an interesting case, and well, it does happen rather
frequently in embedded devices. I just did not consider it in the earlier
reply. If I remember correctly, U-boot does some dt fixups after detecting
things like GPU in case of TI AM62 (used in BeaglePlay and PocketBeagle 2).
