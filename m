--- Patch [11]: [PATCH v6 11/11] drm/mediatek: Add Write DMA (WDMA) Engine =
for Writeback support ---
commit 785dafc39cd5707f8b31637d57cc1e1d14518c1b
Author: AngeloGioacchino Del Regno <angelogioacchino.delregno@collabora.com>
Subject: drm/mediatek: Add Write DMA (WDMA) Engine for Writeback support

This commit adds a basic driver for the Write DMA Engine (WDMA) on MediaTek
MT8173 and Dimensity 1200 MT6893. It hooks the engine into the display
pipeline to enable writeback support for display image capturing.

[Severity: High]
Does setting WDMA_BYPASS_SHADOW break the hardware's ability to atomically
apply updates at the VBLANK boundary?

[Severity: Critical]
Could this corrupt the input framebuffer memory?

By passing pending->addr (the source framebuffer) to
mtk_wdma_ddp_write_dst_addr(), it looks like the writeback hardware is
programmed to write the captured display data directly over the active input
framebuffer, rather than the writeback job's destination address.

> +			   struct mtk_plane_state *state,
> +			   struct cmdq_pkt *cmdq_pkt)
> +{

[Severity: High]
Is this configuration code reachable during normal operation?

WDMA is a writeback engine located at the end of the display pipeline (index
greater than 1). Since mtk_crtc_num_comp_planes() returns 0 for any compone=
nt
index greater than 1, it appears WDMA never receives plane allocations.

This would prevent mtk_ddp_comp_for_plane() from matching it, leaving the
hardware unprogrammed.

ate);
> +}

[Severity: High]
Can this cause a NULL pointer dereference?

If mtk_wdma_layer_config() is executed, it unconditionally calls
drm_writeback_queue_job() with the generic conn_state.

However, mtk_wdma_wb_connector_atomic_commit() already consumes the job and
sets conn_state->writeback_job to NULL earlier in the commit sequence.

nnector,

> +{

[ ... ]

> +	/* Store writeback pending state before queuing the job */
> +	wdma->wb_pending =3D true;

[Severity: High]
Does setting the wb_pending flag before the lock-protected
drm_writeback_queue_job() call introduce a race condition?

If a previous frame's completion interrupt fires in this window,
mtk_disp_wdma_irq_handler() could observe the flag, fail to find the job in
the queue, and clear wb_pending.

The new job would then be queued but never signaled because wb_pending is
now false.

> +
> +	mtk_wdma_ddp_write_dst_addr(NULL, addr, 0, wdma);

[Severity: High]
Could passing NULL for cmdq_pkt cause hardware state corruption?

This forces an immediate, unsynchronized CPU writel() to the hardware
destination registers, bypassing the GCE CMDQ.

Modifying the destination address mid-frame while an active DMA transfer is
occurring might redirect the transfer prematurely.

[Severity: Medium]
Is it intentional to hardcode mtk_wdma_wb_output_formats here (which only
contains DRM_FORMAT_RGB888)?

This ignores the wdma->data->formats array that supports 13 formats, making
the format conversion logic in wdma_fmt_convert() unused and restricting
userspace capabilities.

[Severity: Medium]
Could this lead to spurious warnings?

pm_runtime_get_sync() returns 1 when the device is already active. Checking
if (ret) evaluates to true on success, which would incorrectly print this
warning.

[Severity: High]
Are we sure this will not crash on an unclocked device?

On MediaTek SoCs, writing to unclocked MMSYS registers can result in an
immediate bus hang.

Since the driver lacks dev_pm_ops to link runtime PM to clock management,
pm_runtime_get_sync() does not implicitly enable the clock. Should
clk_prepare_enable() be called explicitly before these writes?

[Severity: Medium]
Does this logic leak the PM usage counter on actual errors?

By calling pm_runtime_put(dev) only when ret >=3D 0, the usage counter
reference acquired by pm_runtime_get_sync() is never dropped if an error
(ret < 0) occurs.
