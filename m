    firmware: drivers: imx: adds miscdev

This commit adds a miscdev character driver for the i.MX secure enclave to
allow user-space applications to exchange messages with NXP secure enclave
hardware. It implements ABI documentation, device contexts, and command
header validation to restrict unsupported operations.

[Severity: High]
Does this create an unbind deadlock if multiple ioctls are running concurre=
ntly?

When se_if_probe_cleanup() runs, it calls complete_all() to wake up the blo=
cked
waiter in ele_msg_rcv(). However, concurrent firmware transactions are seri=
alized
by priv->se_if_cmd_lock.

If Thread A holds se_if_cmd_lock and is blocked in ele_msg_rcv(), and Threa=
d B is
blocked waiting to acquire se_if_cmd_lock, Thread B will miss the complete_=
all()
signal. Once Thread A finishes and releases the lock, Thread B will acquire=
 it,
call reinit_completion() here, and wait for the full timeout. Meanwhile, the
unbind thread will block indefinitely trying to acquire dev_ctx->fops_lock
(which Thread B already holds from se_ioctl).

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but can this lead to data corruption when
userspace is actively reading the response?

When se_if_fops_read() wakes up, it acquires clbk_rx_lock to snapshot the
pointers, then drops the lock and calls copy_to_user(). If the firmware sen=
ds
another command message while copy_to_user() is running, se_if_rx_callback()
will blindly overwrite the shared rx_msg buffer here via memcpy() since it
doesn't check if the buffer is currently being consumed.

[Severity: High]
Can a late mailbox interrupt cause a Use-After-Free of priv by scheduling t=
his
work after the driver has been unbound?

In se_if_probe_cleanup(), cancel_work_sync(&priv->fw_busy_work) is called
before the mailbox channels are freed (mbox_free_channel). If a late mailbox
message arrives right before or during the unbind process, this callback can
evaluate the condition and schedule the work after it was supposedly cancel=
ed,
leading to the workqueue accessing freed memory when the unbind completes.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but could this pass a dangling priv->dev
pointer to dma_free_coherent() if a file descriptor is closed after unbind?

The driver stores a pointer to the platform device in priv->dev in se_if_pr=
obe()
but does not pin it with get_device(). When the device is unbound, the
miscdevice is deregistered, dropping the VFS reference to the parent device.
If userspace still holds an open file descriptor, priv is kept alive, but t=
he
underlying struct device might be freed. When close() is finally called, th=
is
uses the dangling pointer.

[Severity: Medium]
Does this leak the 128KB DMA buffer allocated for priv_dev_ctx during unbin=
d?

When se_if_probe_cleanup() runs, it sets priv->priv_dev_ctx->cleanup_done =
=3D true.
When se_if_priv_release() later calls cleanup_dev_ctx(priv->priv_dev_ctx, f=
alse),
cleanup_dev_ctx() skips freeing the DMA memory via cleanup_se_shared_mem()
because it sees cleanup_done is already true. The context struct is freed, =
but
the DMA memory is permanently leaked.

[Severity: Critical]
Is it safe to clear the circuit breaker and unconditionally free the DMA me=
mory
for legitimately timed-out contexts here?

During teardown, se_if_probe_cleanup() forcefully wakes up any waiting ioct=
ls
using complete_all(). The woken thread in ele_msg_rcv() observes a positive
remaining timeout, thinks it succeeded, and thus skips setting the fw_busy
circuit breaker. It then proceeds to free the DMA memory.

Furthermore, se_clear_fw_busy() is called at the end of unbind, uncondition=
ally
clearing the busy flag and freeing DMA memory for any context that timed out
previously. In both cases, the hardware enclave might still be executing and
actively DMA-writing to that freed physical memory, causing memory corrupti=
on.
