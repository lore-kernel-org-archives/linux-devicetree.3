accel/rocket: add RK3576 NPU (RKNN) support

This commit adds RK3576 support to the rocket DRM accelerator driver. It
introduces new clocks, power domains, and a polled completion mechanism
since the RK3576 has no maskable completion interrupt.

[Severity: High]
Does this early return leak resources?

In rocket_core_init(), rocket_job_init() is called earlier, which allocates
non-devm resources such as an ordered workqueue and a DRM scheduler.

If devm_pm_domain_attach_list() fails, the function returns directly with
dev_err_probe() and skips the necessary rocket_job_fini() and
iommu_group_put() cleanup.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does this power down the device without
synchronizing the shared IRQ?

Since the driver uses IRQF_SHARED, another device sharing the IRQ line could
trigger the interrupt handler just as the clocks are being disabled.

Can this race condition cause the IRQ handler to execute on powered-down
hardware, potentially leading to a kernel panic? Should we call
synchronize_irq() before turning off the clocks?

[Severity: High]
Can a DMA error on RK3576 trigger a race condition that corrupts hardware
state?

On RK3576, a DMA error drops OPERATION_ENABLE to 0 and raises a DMA error
interrupt. This simultaneously triggers the threaded IRQ handler and the
poll timer workqueue, which will both see OPERATION_ENABLE =3D=3D 0.

Both threads will concurrently invoke rocket_job_handle_irq(). Because this
function clears OPERATION_ENABLE outside the job_lock, one thread can write
0 to OPERATION_ENABLE right after the other thread has already submitted the
next job and written 1.

Does this permanently halt the hardware by leaving the newly submitted job
disabled?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does this leak the IOMMU group reference?

The call to iommu_group_get() increments the reference count, but
iommu_detach_group() does not consume or release it.

Since job completion is a hot path, will this quickly overflow the refcount
or leak memory? Should the driver just use the already cached
core->iommu_group instead?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but can this unconditional MMIO read cause a
bus fault if the device is suspended?

Because the driver uses IRQF_SHARED, another device could trigger
rocket_job_irq_handler() while the NPU is runtime suspended and powered dow=
n.
Reading from a powered-down device typically returns garbage data or causes=
 a
synchronous external abort.

Should we use pm_runtime_get_if_active() to verify the device is powered
before touching MMIO registers?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but can calling drm_sched_fini() here cause a
kernel panic?

If drm_sched_init() fails internally (e.g., due to memory allocation failur=
e),
the waitqueues and lists inside the scheduler structure are left uninitiali=
zed.
When we jump to the err_sched label, drm_sched_fini() will unconditionally
try to wake up these uninitialized waitqueues.

[Severity: High]
Is there a teardown order race that allows the hrtimer to be re-armed after
cancellation?

The poll timer and workqueue are cancelled before stopping the DRM schedule=
r.
If a concurrent scheduler thread pulls a pending job and calls
rocket_job_hw_submit(), it will restart poll_timer.

Can this lead to a use-after-free when the timer fires on freed memory after
teardown completes? Should we stop the scheduler before cancelling the time=
r?
