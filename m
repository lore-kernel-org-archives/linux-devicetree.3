I don't think we need two people working on this and you did the better
investigation into the differences, so you should get the credit :-)

So I guess my preference would be to:
=2D pick up the erratum 6 into your patch
=2D add my haikou patch to the series - that way we also get a user
=2D handle Krzysztof's comment from
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/20260701-sensible-cryptic-ocelot-5=
8035b@quoll/

  as both our bindings have the same structure, so I guess it should be

    oneOf:
       - enum:
             rockchip,rk3568v2-canfd
             rockchip,rk3588v2-canfd
       - items:
           - const: rockchip,rk3568v3-canfd
           - const: rockchip,rk3568v2-canfd

And submit that as v2.

It's already in the commit message, so that should be fine

I was more going by the fact that even Rockchip removed every mention of
the -FD from all documentation, so was assuming it still being broken as
before. But if it actually works, then personally I'm more than fine with
enabling CAN-FD :-D .

I guess Marc might have more insight where the FD issue triggered on
the RK3568.
