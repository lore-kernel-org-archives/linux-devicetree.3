Thanks for the clarification.

IIUC, this means my original point stands: the #thermal-sensor-cells
property is optional, and only needed if SCMI sensors (the "provider")
are referenced by a consumer, such as "thermal-sensors".

What about the following update then:

If you think this is unnecessary complication or verbosity, I can drop
it; it's just that I'd like to construct a minimal "protocol@15" node
for my use case (a particular DTS I'm extending), and be able to justify
every little part of that addition. Presently I can't justify
"#thermal-sensor-cells", so I'd like to leave it out -- but currently
that would conflict with the documentation (even though it wouldn't
cause a problem for any of the drivers included / activated).

Thanks!
Laszlo
