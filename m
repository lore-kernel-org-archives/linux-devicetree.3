Hi Brian, Miquel,

Thanks Brian for the summary, and Miquel for testing and posting this.
The i.MX8MP LDB/pixel case is a real problem and I'd like us to solve
it. My concerns are about how, more than whether.

You got most of it. The main nuance is I want to convey is where it
should live IMO: not in a divider helper, and not in providers at all,
but in the core. I'll try to explain.

So far, CCF has preserved the settings of each element, or more
honestly, left them alone: if a divider divides by 4, it keeps doing so
whatever happens to its parent. This behavior has been there for years
and many devices rely on it, even if unknowingly. Miquel, I understand
you would rather make the new behavior the default, but I think this one
is here to stay. That said, it would be nice to have a way to say that
the rate should be preserved rather than the setting. I'll come back
to that.

My first concern is about the responsibilities of each component. IMO a
provider should only describe the transfer function it implements:
"given this parent rate, here is what I can do". It should not walk
the tree or care about what its children are doing. Coordinating the
providers is the core's job, without assumptions about their transfer
functions.

Providers already query their parents: a mux asks each candidate
parent what it can provide, and a clock with CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT
forwards its request upward. That is the request path, and the core
stays in charge of it. Reading the state of children or siblings, and
deciding on their behalf, is a different thing. Once a provider is
allowed to do that, there is no good reason to deny it to the others,
and I think that would make the core much harder to maintain. It could
also get in the way of other pressing work, like the global lock problem,
where tree walking will certainly play a critical role. Miquel's
patch 2 is a good illustration: the helper ends up comparing the
clk_hw of the tree with the inner clk_hw of a composite, which is not
part of the tree.

My second concern is that it is tied to the integer divider, since it
relies on the LCM. If another element with a different transfer
function sits on the path, it does not work, as we discussed. We could
extend the principle to other types, but:
* I don't see how the different types would reconcile, since each one
  does its own thing in its own .determine_rate();
* the change is no longer simple and harmless if it has to spread to
  every provider to work.

The behavior is also hard for consumers to predict. For example, the
parent rate is only negotiated with the subtree of the divider's
direct parent. With a gate between the divider and the PLL, the other
branches of the PLL are left out. That could be fixed with more tree
walking in the provider, which brings us back to my first point.

If such a mechanism is needed, I would much prefer it done entirely in
the core, in a generic way, with no assumption about the transfer
functions involved. I realize this may go against a direction
suggested at a previous LPC, which this series followed, and I think the
points above are worth reconsidering it for.

I say "if" because I doubt clock trees are designed with runtime rate
negotiation in mind. So far, we have mostly dealt with these cases by
removing CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT and using assigned-clock-rates on the
shared ancestor. I understand that falls short when the PLL has to
follow the display mode, as here.

For rate negotiation, my suggestion would be to reuse what the
framework already has: clock ranges, and re-running .determine_rate()
on the children being dragged along, with the common ancestor's rate
pinned. When that rate does not suit a sibling's range, other ancestor
rates can be tried within the constraints, rather than giving up.

clk_set_rate() is a best effort function. It tries to get as close to
the request as possible, honoring the ranges of every clock along the
path, and it is up to the consumer to decide whether the result is
good enough. That decision is lost if the framework recomputes the
rates of a sibling branch on its own. Ranges could help it decide:
either "I'm fine with the new rate", or -EBUSY.

What I'm suggesting is to treat any clock with a range as one that
needs updating. Its consumer cared enough to tell us what it can and
cannot cope with. That removes the need for a specific flag, and puts
the rate policy in the consumer, which is where I'd prefer use case
choices to live, rather than in the provider or the core. It would
also fix clocks being dragged out of their range during an update.
Presumably, a clock without a range does not care enough to give us a
decider, so the framework has no basis to act on its behalf and keeps
today's behavior. I think this behavior will keep on being good enough
for the vast majority clocks out there and it is a lot lighter
on the math side (which is already quite severe as it is)

I've been checking whether the idea is remotely feasible. It involves
multiple planning stages and multiple tops. It is still very rough,
but there is the beginning of something:

https://github.com/jbrun3t/linux/commits/clk/clk-rate-range-update/

Miquel, if you fancy trying it, please let me know whether it works
for you. All you should need is to set a range on the clocks you care
about.

Sorry for this rather long explanation.

Brian, your series is what got this discussion going, I know a lot of
efforts have gone into it already. I'd be glad to work on this together.
