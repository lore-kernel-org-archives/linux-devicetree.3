I have no precise plan yet, but my idea is close. Since we basically program
the DDICs in panel drivers, which are bridges, just move them as bridges with
perhaps a set of panel DDIC helpers to reduce the burden to write a full
bridge driver and then declare the actual physical panel as connected to
the final bridge connector.

Having a proper "panel" described would be the key to the move, but the more
I dig the more it needs to be a generalized solution across DRM.
I had some feedback about how this would solve issues people struggle have
with advanced monitors arrangements and advanced features like Tiled Display, etc...

But yeah let's meet in Prague a discuss about this, I'll be pleasure to you
again in person, it has been a while !
