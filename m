The problem of selecting "after-market hardware description" will remain
as long as "BIOS" ships without upstream-compliant descriptions. I'm not
sure I understand in what way your comment relate to the patchset at
hand though.

We supported this on SDM850 and 8cx, we had sufficient amount of
support/quirks in Linux to allow you to boot and run the Debian
installer - but that's how far it was possible to push things without
improving ACPI specification and tables.

Given that you couldn't run any real use cases, this was not adequately
maintained and as we moved on to 8cx Gen3 I argued that we should
prioritize the DT-effort.

But this proposal doesn't give you ACPI+DT, it gives you DT+ACPI, you
still need a base DT that is somewhat functional - and then you
explicitly need to make references to the external ACPI representation.

Quite nice for experimentation, but I don't think it will solve either
of your problems.
