You could also simplify it to

&i2c1 {
	fpga@10 {
		compatible = "visioncomponents,vc-mipi-controller";
		reg = <0x10>;

		i2c@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			ov9282: camera-sensor@60 {
				compatible = "ovti,ov9282";
				reg = <0x60>;
				...
			};
		};
	};
};

and use a single driver that registers an I2C mux (and instantiate I2C
child devices) as well as a regulator, without using the MFD framework.
That could reduce the runtime complexity, which would be nice. If you
prefer using the MFD framework with more complex bindings I'm not
opposed to it though.
