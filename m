(1) Are you saying that the property "#thermal-sensor-cells", under
protocol@15, is actually a *misnomer* today, and it is in fact a
*generic* specification of the Sensor ID width -- regardless of any
referring stanzas elsewhere in the Device Tree (of which there may be
none, or some may be thermal-UNrelated)?

(2) If so, would you accept a patch for
"Documentation/devicetree/bindings/firmware/arm,scmi.yaml" that points
out the above fact in a "description" yaml key?

(3) Where exactly does the kernel consume "#thermal-sensor-cells" in the
proposed (general) sense?

I can only find matches for the property name in
"drivers/thermal/thermal_of.c" and
"drivers/thermal/ti-soc-thermal/ti-thermal-common.c", but those appear
like thermal drivers, not general SCMI stuff. AIUI,
of_thermal_zone_find() in the former consults "#thermal-sensor-cells" in
the "provider" (such as SCMI protocol@15) to figure out the expected
argument cell count in the "thermal-sensors" list.

But that implies that, if there ever was another (non-thermal) driver
that wanted to reference SCMI sensor identifiers similarly, it would
also have to consult "#thermal-sensor-cells", for the argument cell
count. Which seems to support the idea that "#thermal-sensor-cells"
counts as a misnomer today. Is that right?

My bad, should be fixed now. (I've tested it with another external
addressee.)

Thank you,
