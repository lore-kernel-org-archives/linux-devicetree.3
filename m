Yes, exactly this. I'm not sure if you can have both in a single module 
.ko file, but your driver can have multiple modules.

To clarify: background color is a hardware feature.  Pixels have an 
alpha channel that blends them with the underlying plane.  On the 
primary plane, there's no underlying plane. So it would be black. Some 
hardware also allows to configure this to some other color per CRTC.

Indeed. I think, if you want to add some more advanced features, you 
will need more memory for the device.
