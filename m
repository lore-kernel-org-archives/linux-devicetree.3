if (compatible("mx8q"))
   something->prefetch_op = somefunction;

And then wherever is prefetch used, do

if (something->prefetch_op)
   something->prefetch_op()

Or something along those lines ?

Is the prefetch engine actually grown into the CRTC/DE or not ? I 
suspect it is separate and instead part of the built-in DMA, right ?

Can't we simply have two sets of ops (one for mx8q and one for mx95) for 
those ops which are too complicated to implement as a single op with 
if/else statements ?

The downside is lack of code reuse, which leads to disparate sets of 
bugs in these two drivers and code duplication. And it seems to me, that 
large parts of the MX8Q and MX95 DC are effectively identical.

Do you perceive that the DC driver cannot be parametrized easily enough 
that it has to be turned into a library like that ? When I look at this 
patchset, esp. the first half which updates the various blocks, it does 
not seem to me that way.
