Chipwealth CH1115 is a controller for monochrome dot matrix OLED panels.
Add DRM support for this chip using i2c bus.

[Severity: Medium]
Is this offset calculation correct for when flip_vertical is false? If
y_start_offset is 0, this evaluates to 64. Display offset values for this
controller type are 6-bit and must be strictly between 0 and 63. Sending 64
might be out of bounds and could corrupt the internal display state machine.

x1 / 8);

[Severity: High]
Could this calculation result in an out-of-bounds heap memory access? The
damage rectangles returned by drm_atomic_helper_damage_iter_next are in
plane source coordinates. If a user sets a non-zero plane source offset or a
framebuffer larger than the panel, rect->x1 and rect->y1 can exceed the
panel dimensions, causing the absolute offsets to point outside the hwbuf
allocation. These coordinates should be translated to the plane's destinati=
on
coordinates first.

[Severity: Medium]
Are we guaranteed that rect->x1 and rect->x2 are aligned to byte boundaries?
The monochrome conversion helper drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_mono assumes the start
pixel maps to bit 0. If rect->x1 is not a multiple of 8, converted pixels
will be shifted improperly in the destination byte, corrupting the image and
overwriting adjacent pre-existing pixels outside the clip boundary.

[Severity: High]
Can this index exceed the bounds of the row array? Similar to the hwbuf off=
set
above, rect->x1 and rect->x2 can exceed the panel width if the plane source
coordinates are larger than the display, writing out of bounds into the hea=
p.

[Severity: High]
Should we call drm_format_conv_state_reserve here? Because the driver uses
drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_mono during the atomic update phase, failing to reserve
the format conversion state here (where sleeping is allowed) forces a
GFP_KERNEL allocation inside the non-failable atomic update path.

> +				      &shadow_plane_state->fmtcnv_state);

[Severity: High]
Does this sequence allocate memory in atomic context? Since
drm_format_conv_state_reserve is not called in atomic_check, the
drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_mono helper (invoked by ch1115_prepare_buffer) will atte=
mpt
a GFP_KERNEL allocation. This causes a scheduling while atomic panic.

> +
> +		ch1115_fb_update_rect(fb, &damage);

[Severity: High]
Can this trigger a sleep while in atomic context? The ch1115_fb_update_rect
function issues I2C commands. The DRM subsystem strictly forbids sleeping in
plane atomic update callbacks, but i2c_transfer acquires a mutex and will
trigger a scheduling while atomic kernel panic.

[Severity: High]
Is it safe to issue I2C commands directly in the encoder enable callback? T=
his
path executes in atomic context where sleeping is prohibited, but
ch1115_send_command_list triggers an i2c_transfer which can sleep.

[Severity: High]
Does this hardware access need drm_dev_enter and drm_dev_exit protection?
Unlike the plane update functions, the encoder enable callback accesses the
regmap directly without verifying if the device is still plugged in. If an
atomic commit races with device unplug, this attempts a use-after-free on
the devm-managed regmap.

[Severity: High]
Does this sleeping function also violate the atomic context constraints? Ju=
st
like the enable callback, atomic_disable executes in atomic context and can=
not
use i2c_transfer.

[Severity: High]
Is the regmap access protected here? Similar to the enable callback, this
requires drm_dev_enter and drm_dev_exit to avoid a use-after-free on device
unplug.

[Severity: High]
What happens if the device tree provides 0 for either of these dimensions?
The parsing validates the upper bounds but missing a check against zero
would cause the hwbuf and row allocations to request 0 bytes. This returns
the ZERO_SIZE_PTR (0x10), leading to a kernel panic upon dereference.

> +				     (ch1115->width * ch1115->height) / 8,
> +				     GFP_KERNEL);

[Severity: High]
Can this allocation be smaller than the required buffer size? The size is
calculated without padding, but ch1115_prepare_buffer converts formats
using a pitch of DIV_ROUND_UP(width, 8). If width is not a multiple of 8,
drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_mono will write past the end of the allocation.

[Severity: Medium]
Should drm_dev_unregister be called before turning off the hardware? By
shutting down the panel while it is still registered, there is a window
where userspace can perform atomic commits on a powered-off display, which
could leave the hardware in an inconsistent state.

[Severity: High]
Will using drm_dev_unregister here instead of drm_dev_unplug cause problems
for devm allocations? Calling drm_dev_unregister leaves the dev->unplugged
flag unset. This allows drm_dev_enter to succeed even after the device is
unbound. Delayed atomic commits could then bypass drm_dev_enter and access
the freed devm-managed memory.
