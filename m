accel/rocket: let the core suspend after a reset

This patch modifies rocket_reset to drop the PM reference using
pm_runtime_put_autosuspend, allowing the core to suspend and trigger
a bus interface reset upon resuming.

[Severity: High]
Does using the asynchronous pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() here prevent the
required power domain cycle?

If a queued job is submitted immediately after reset, couldn't the autosusp=
end
timer be canceled before the core actually suspends?

rocket_reset() finishes by restarting the scheduler:

    /* Restart the scheduler */
    drm_sched_start(&core->sched, 0);

If the scheduler restarts and the next job runs immediately, it will take a
PM reference and cancel the autosuspend timer before the suspend happens.
Would using a synchronous suspend instead guarantee the hardware ordering
constraints are met?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does detaching the IOMMU here before halt=
ing
the hardware risk SMMU translation faults?

If a hung job leaves the hardware actively attempting DMA transactions,
detaching the IOMMU unmaps the device's DMA domain while the transactions a=
re
still in flight.

The hardware is reset and halted after the IOMMU group is already detached:

    iommu_detach_group(NULL, core->iommu_group);
    ...
    /* Proceed with reset now. */
    rocket_core_reset(core);

Should the hardware be halted prior to revoking its DMA mappings?

[ ... ]

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but does the shared IRQ handler
access hardware registers without verifying the device's PM state?

In rocket_job_irq_handler(), the handler reads a hardware register on a sha=
red
IRQ line:

    u32 raw_status =3D rocket_pc_readl(core, INTERRUPT_RAW_STATUS);

If an interrupt fires for another device sharing the same IRQ line while the
NPU is runtime suspended, won't this read unclocked hardware registers and
potentially cause an asynchronous SError panic?

Additionally, in rocket_device_runtime_suspend(), the hardware is powered d=
own
without synchronizing with in-flight shared IRQs:

    clk_bulk_disable_unprepare(rdev->cores[core].soc->num_clks,=20
                               rdev->cores[core].clks);

Could this crash the kernel if the handler is executing mid-flight while the
clocks are disabled?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does rocket_job_next_locked() leak an IOM=
MU
group reference on every normal job completion?

The group reference count is incremented but not decremented when detaching:

    iommu_detach_group(NULL, iommu_group_get(core->dev));

Because jobs execute continuously, won't this eventually saturate the refco=
unt
and permanently leak the IOMMU group object on teardown?
