This series adds initial support for the Ayaneo Pocket DS, a handheld
gaming console built around the Qualcomm QCS8550 SoC. It has UFS
storage, WiFi/Bluetooth, gaming buttons, microSD, and USB-C with
DisplayPort. Game controls are exposed through a Renesas uPD720201
PCIe USB 3.0 host controller hung off PCIe1, while a dedicated gamepad
MCU is reached over UART11.

The series is structured as:

  1. dt-bindings entry for the new ayaneo,pocket-ds compatible.
  2. sm8550.dtsi: add the QUP2 SE3 (UART11) controller node and its
     default pinctrl, so the board can enable it as &uart11.
  3. The Pocket DS board device tree itself, together with thermal_*
     labels for the cpuss/cpu/gpuss thermal zones added to sm8550.dtsi
     so the board has a real user of them in the same patch.

Only the basics are wired up at this stage (boot to console, core
peripherals, USB-C with DP and SBU AUX muxing, microSD, WiFi/BT,
gaming controls, volume keys, the RGB power LED and PWM-fan cooling),
plus the lower DSI panel in patch 4.

The upper panel is still missing. Its Chipone ICNA3512 binding makes
disp-supply and blvdd-supply mandatory, and this board has no
separately controllable rail for either: the vendor device tree drives
the upper panel through a platform enable GPIO and points the panel
node at the simulator supply list, and holding that GPIO low on the
device does not stop the panel initialising. It will follow once the
wiring is confirmed.

Changes in v6:
- board dts: renamed the uart11 alias from hsuart0 to serial2. uart11 is
  a plain serial engine like uart7 and uart14; hsuart0 in-tree only
  labels the sc7180/trogdor Bluetooth UART (Konrad).
- board dts: dropped output-low from the fan_pwr_active pinctrl state.
  vdd_fan_5v0 is a regulator-fixed with gpios = <&tlmm 31 ...>, so the
  gpiod API already drives the pin (Konrad).
- board dts: reordered the codec node before cpu in both dai-links of
  the sound node (Konrad).
- board dts: kept output-high on the gamepad_pwr_en pinctrl state.
  Unlike fan_pwr_active, gpio52 has no GPIO consumer anywhere in the
  device tree, so pinctrl is the only thing asserting it; dropping it
  leaves the uPD720201 gamepad host controller unpowered. This mirrors
  the already-merged sm8650-ayaneo-pocket-s2.dts and reverses a v4
  removal that v5 restored. Happy to model it as a fixed regulator
  instead if that is preferred.
- Rebased onto next-20260824. Three fallouts from the newer base, all in
  the board dts:
    * &pcieport0 is now &pcie0_port0 in sm8550.dtsi.
    * the uPD720201 node moved from an inline pcie@0 child of &pcie1 to
      the &pcie1_port0 label, matching sm8650-ayaneo-pocket-s2.
    * &ipa now carries memory-region = <&ipa_fw_mem>, so deleting the
      ipa_fw_mem reserved-memory node left a dangling phandle and dtc
      refused to build. Added /delete-property/ memory-region on &ipa,
      the same treatment &remoteproc_mpss and &remoteproc_cdsp already
      get; &ipa is status = "disabled" on this board.
- board dts: added the RGB power LED under &pm8550_pwm, shaped like the
  multi-led node already in sm8650-ayaneo-pocket-s2.
- New patch 4/4 adding the lower DSI panel (ST7703 + SGM3804 + SY7758 +
  TCA6408 rails). It is kept separate because it depends on four
  bindings that only reached linux-next recently, so patches 1-3 can be
  applied without waiting for them.
- Picked up Konrad's Reviewed-by on the board dts patch. It predates the
  RGB LED node above; happy to drop it if you would rather re-review.
- Link to v5: https://patch.msgid.link/20260723-pocketds-v5-0-74508388c716@gmail.com

Changes in v5:
- Restore output-high on the gamepad_pwr_en pinctrl state: the Renesas
  uPD720201 gamepad host controller power-enable on gpio52 must be
  driven high. It was dropped in v4 together with the boot-time
  output-high states, but unlike those it is a functional enable
  rather than a downstream boot artefact (Sashiko).
- Link to v4: https://patch.msgid.link/20260722-pocketds-v4-0-438704cd51f7@gmail.com

Changes in v4:
- Reordered the series so the sm8550.dtsi UART11 patch comes before the
  board dts that consumes &uart11, keeping the tree bisectable (Dmitry).
- Renamed the board compatible from "ayaneo,pocketds" to
  "ayaneo,pocket-ds", matching the hyphenated "ayaneo,pocket-s2" already
  in qcom.yaml and the DT compatible naming convention (Sashiko). The
  Acked-by on the bindings patch was given for the unhyphenated string;
  kept it since the change is a one-word rename, please shout if you
  would rather re-ack it.
- uart11: switched operating-points-v2 to &qup_opp_table_120mhz, which
  is what i2c11 and spi11 use for the very same serial engine at
  0x88c000; the 100 MHz table was simply wrong (Sashiko).
- uart11: use bias-pull-up rather than bias-disable on TX/RX, matching
  qup_uart14_default, the other high-speed UART on this SoC (Sashiko).
- Reworded the UART11 commit message, which implied that open-coding
  the controller in a board dts was a viable alternative (Konrad).
- Squashed the sm8550.dtsi thermal-zone labels patch into the board
  dts patch so the labels gain their consumer in the same change
  (Krzysztof).
- Renamed the sm8550.dtsi thermal-zone labels from
  cpuss[0-3]_thermal / cpu7_top_thermal / gpuss[0-7]_thermal to
  thermal_cpuss[0-3] / thermal_cpu7_top / thermal_gpuss[0-7] so all
  thermal-related overrides cluster alphabetically in the consuming
  board dts (Dmitry).
- Dropped the &gpu_opp_table override until upstream gains proper
  speed-bin detection (Dmitry).
- Switched remoteproc_adsp firmware-name from the downstream .mdt
  suffix to the upstream .mbn convention (Dmitry).
- Replaced the /delete-node/ overrides on &remoteproc_mpss /
  &remoteproc_cdsp with /delete-property/ memory-region (Dmitry). Both
  are already status="disabled" in sm8550.dtsi, so the nodes never
  needed deleting; only their now-dangling memory-region phandles did.
  The reserved-memory regions for the unused modem, CDSP, camera and
  IPA firmware stay /delete-node/-ed so that memory is handed back to
  Linux, matching what sm8550-samsung-q5q and
  sm8550-sony-xperia-yodo-pdx234 already do on this SoC.
- Dropped the downstream rocknix-u-boot-dt-id root property (Neil).
- Switched the deprecated "gpio" property to "gpios" on all fixed
  regulators (Neil).
- Reworked the audio-routing DAPM table to drop the bogus
  "VA DMIC0/1, vdd-micb" routes (Neil).
- Reshaped the per-zone thermal-zones overrides to a single "active"
  trip point bound to &pwm_fan via cooling-maps, mirroring the
  Ayaneo Pocket S2 style (Neil).
- Added a pinctrl-1 sleep state for pwm_fan and the corresponding
  fan_pwm_sleep PMIC pinctrl entry (Neil).
- Added a gpio-keys node wiring up the Volume Up button via the
  previously-unreferenced volume_up_n pinctrl (Neil).
- Dropped every output-high in the &tlmm pinctrl states (Neil).
- Dropped the incomplete DSI/panel bring-up (display_panel, &mdss_dsi0,
  &mdss_dsi0_phy, &mdss_dsi1, &mdss_dsi1_out, &mdss_dsi1_phy and the
  sde_dsi*/sde_te*/panel_pwr_active pinctrl) until the panel bindings
  are reviewed (Neil).
- Added the missing SBU AUX endpoint between the pmic-glink connector
  and the NB7VPQ904M redriver port@2 to complete the DP altmode
  signal path (Neil).
- Normalised the last fixed-regulator node name to the "<name>-regulator"
  convention (vph_pwr) (Krzysztof).
- Reauthored the bindings patch under Alexandre alone (no co-developed
  needed for the trivial DT entry) and picked up Krzysztof's Acked-by.
- Fixed the sign-off chain on the board dts patch: the From: author's
  Signed-off-by now comes first and the submitter's last (Krzysztof).
- No qup_uart11_cts_rts pinctrl state was added: nothing in-tree
  references it, and hardware flow control is not wired on this board.
  It can be added together with its first user (Sashiko).
- Built with "make CHECK_DTBS=yes qcom/qcs8550-ayaneo-pocket-ds.dtb":
  no errors, no warnings. With W=1 dtc additionally reports
  avoid_unnecessary_addr_size on sm8550.dtsi's dsi@ae94000/dsi@ae96000,
  because no panel child is added while display support is deferred;
  qcs8550-aim300-aiot already reports the same for dsi@ae96000.
- board dts: enabled &pcie0_phy and added the &pcieport0 wifi@0 supply
  node for the WCN7850. Without the PCIe0 PHY and the vddpcie0p9 /
  vddpcie1p8 rails the WiFi link never trained; the wifi@0 supply node
  follows sm8650-ayaneo-pocket-s2 and the sm8550/sm8650 QRD/HDK boards.
- board dts: dropped &i2c4 to 100 kHz. The FT5426 touchscreen
  clock-stretches past the GENI controller's timeout at 400 kHz, and
  the qcom-geni-i2c controller has no i2c_bus_recovery, so a stuck SCL
  can only be cleared by an FSM reset that is itself the operation
  timing out. Standard mode is within the FT5426's clock-stretch spec.
- board dts: pinned &pcie0 to max-link-speed = <2> (Gen2), the link
  speed validated for the WCN7850 on this board.
- board dts: dropped the undocumented sdhci-caps-mask = <0x3 0x0> on
  &sdhc_2 (it masked the SDR50/SDR104 capability bits that the board's
  own sd-uhs-sdr50 / sd-uhs-sdr104 properties enable). qcom,dll-config
  is kept, with its derivation now recorded in the commit message.
- Renamed the board dts to qcs8550-ayaneo-pocket-ds.dts to match the
  hyphenated compatible and the sibling sm8650-ayaneo-pocket-s2.dts;
  the Makefile entry and the CHECK_DTBS target were updated to suit.
- Note on the UART11 Reviewed-by: Konrad's tag was given on v3, before
  the operating-points-v2 (&qup_opp_table_120mhz) and bias-pull-up
  changes above. It is retained here; happy to drop it for a re-review.
- Link to v3: https://patch.msgid.link/20260517-pocketds-v3-0-d5910c801756@gmail.com

Changes in v3:
- New prerequisite patch adding the QUP2 SE3 (UART11) controller node
  and the qup_uart11_default pinctrl state to sm8550.dtsi, so the
  board can enable the gamepad MCU UART via &uart11 instead of
  duplicating the controller node in the board dts.
- Alphabetised the root-level nodes in the board dts and renamed the
  fixed regulators to the "<name>-regulator" node-name convention.
- Link to v2: https://patch.msgid.link/20260511-pocketds-v2-0-299dd4247f2f@gmail.com

Changes in v2:
- Inlined the board into a single qcs8550-ayaneo-pocketds.dts, matching
  the sm8650-ayaneo-pocket-s2 layout
- Added qcom,qcs8550 to the compatible chain
- Prerequisite patch labelling the sm8550 thermal zones so the board
  can extend them via &label overrides (and refactored the board's
  thermal-zones to use them)
- Added the Renesas uPD720201 USB 3.0 controller as a child of pcie1
  with proper avdd33 / vdd10 / vdd33 regulators
- Moved gamepad_pwr_en off &pcie1's pinctrl-0 and onto the
  usb-controller node
- Split the lumped upd720201_active pinctrl into per-regulator states
- Fixed mdss_dp0_out data-lanes to <0 1 2 3> (all four wired)
- Fixed gpio-reserved-ranges to <32 4> (gpio 38-39 drive the Goodix
  touchscreen)
- Renamed nodes with underscores (llcc-lpi-region, splash-region,
  gpio@20) per DT conventions
- Reordered pinctrl-names after pinctrl-N file-wide
- Dropped the unused cont_splash_region label
- Link to v1: https://patch.msgid.link/20260510-pocketds-v1-0-cf05acec06af@gmail.com
