Just fail. You are in the probe path, so it's OK.

There is no problem with the code in this patch alone.

The problem is when in two years in the future we do implement 15
bits. (That's an example to explain the principle, I don't expect it to
happen with this driver.) But imagine in the future we add:

	switch (bus_width) {
    +	case 15:
    +		mxsfb->bus_format =3D MEDIA_BUS_FMT_RGB555_1X15;
    +		break;
	case 16:
		mxsfb->bus_format =3D MEDIA_BUS_FMT_RGB565_1X16;
		break;

At that point the device in the wild with the incorrect 'bus-width =3D <15>=
'
will start using RGB555 and fail, because they really have a 18 bit panel
which worked thanks to the automagic "if DT is wrong, let's go with the
default". That's a regression for that device.

Reporting an error from day 0 means 'bus-width =3D <15>' will be blocked, t=
he
device won't probe and the mistake in the device tree gets fixed before
shipping.

I hope it's clearer now.

Cheers,
Luca
