Syscon is no bus, this is a special MFD device. TBH I've never seen a
dt-binding which makes use of the 'reg' property to abstract the
different MFD functionalities. E.g. the imx6qdl.dtsi anatop syscon
doesn't make use of the reg property either. Instead the different
drivers ensure that only the required registers and bits are touched.

The LDB is no special device here except for the fact that NXP bundled
the LDB bits into two dedicated registers of the syscon (iomux-gpr for
imx6sx and blkctrl for imx8mp,imx93). Unfortunately this wasn't possible
for the other IPs and therefore the LDB is rather the exception than the
rule.

We're speaking about commit 8aa2f0ac08d3 ("dt-bindings: display: bridge:
ldb: Add check for reg and reg-names"). This commit enforces the 'reg'
property and is part of Linux since 7.0-rc1. So there shouldn't be an
issue with the backward compatiblity.

It's up to the DT maintainers to make a decision if it's allowed to
revert the patch which marks the reg property as required, therefore I
added them explicit to the To:.

Regarding the actual DT node name: There are examples which renamed the
node in a non backward compatible way, e.g. the remove of the leading
zeros from @0003000. This is also up to the DT maintainers.

Honestly I don't know why this is such a big deal here. I get the fact
that you want to move forward with the i.MX93 but this patch complicates
the handling for something which shouldn't be that complicated. By
removing the complexity we make more maintainable.

There are two points:
 - Don't mark the 'reg' property as required -> revert commit
   8aa2f0ac08d3 (see above explanation)
 - Fix the DT nodes incl. the names

I can provide these patches if you want, unfortunately I'm deep in
project related work and had no time yet to do this :/

  Marco
