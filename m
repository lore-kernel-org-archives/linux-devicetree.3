Hello,

I tested patches 1/5 through 5/5 from the MT8173 PowerVR v3 series on
an Acer Chromebook R13 (Google Elm), which uses an MT8173 SoC and a
PowerVR Rogue GX6250 GPU with BVNC 4.40.2.51.

For clarity, I applied the five actual patches numbered 1/5 through
5/5. The 0/5 cover letter itself was not applied.

Kernel:
  Linux 7.1.3-stb-cbm-pvr-v3

Relevant kernel configuration:
  CONFIG_DRM_POWERVR=3Dm
  CONFIG_COMMON_CLK_MT8173_MFGTOP=3Dy

Kernel command line:
  powervr.exp_hw_support=3D1

Firmware:
  powervr/rogue_4.40.2.51_v1.fw

The driver probes successfully, loads the firmware, and initializes the
DRM device:

  [    6.110569] powervr 13000000.gpu:
                 [drm] Running on unknown hardware; expect issues.
  [    6.117454] powervr 13000000.gpu:
                 [drm] loaded firmware
                 powervr/rogue_4.40.2.51_v1.fw
  [    6.118010] powervr 13000000.gpu:
                 [drm] FW version v1.0 (build 6476056 OS)
  [    6.122992] [drm] Initialized powervr 1.0.0
                 for 13000000.gpu on minor 1

The following DRM device nodes are created:

  /dev/dri/card0
  /dev/dri/card1
  /dev/dri/renderD128

However, on a clean boot, without manually running vulkaninfo, vkcube,
or another Vulkan application, the driver reports that the GPU has been
lost approximately six seconds after DRM initialization:

  [   12.084078] powervr 13000000.gpu:
                [drm] *ERROR* GPU device lost

The relevant boot sequence is therefore:

  [    6.110569] PowerVR probe begins
  [    6.117454] Firmware is loaded
  [    6.118010] Firmware version is reported
  [    6.122992] DRM initialization completes
  [   12.084078] GPU device lost

The unused-regulator shutdown occurs considerably later:

  [   31.712124] vgpu: disabling

Therefore, the later "vgpu: disabling" message does not appear to be
the immediate cause of the device loss. The GPU is reported lost about
20 seconds before that regulator shutdown message.

After the failure, regulator_summary reports:

  vgpu  0  0  0  normal  1000mV  0mA  700mV  1350mV

This output was collected after the GPU had already been reported lost,
so I do not know whether the regulator state was different during probe
or immediately before the failure.

The PowerVR-related clocks appear enabled in clk_summary:

  mfg_26m       26000000 Hz

  mem_mfg_in_sel
    rate:       455000000 Hz
    enable:     1
    prepare:    1

  mfg_mem
    rate:       455000000 Hz
    enable:     1
    prepare:    1

    clock name: mem

    enable:     1
    prepare:    1
    consumer:   13000000.gpu
    clock name: core

  axi_mfg_in_sel
    rate:       208000000 Hz
    enable:     2
    prepare:    2
    consumer:   power-domain@7

  mfg_axi
    rate:       208000000 Hz
    enable:     1
    prepare:    1
    consumer:   13000000.gpu
    clock name: sys

I also installed Mesa 26.1.5 and vulkan-powervr 26.1.5 and tested the
Vulkan ICD with:

  PVR_I_WANT_A_BROKEN_VULKAN_DRIVER=3D1 \
  VK_DRIVER_FILES=3D/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/powervr_mesa_icd.json \
  vulkaninfo --summary

The PowerVR ICD was found and loaded. Before hanging, Mesa printed:

  WARNING: powervr is not a conformant Vulkan implementation,
           testing use only.

  FINISHME: Missing reset support for brn51764
  FINISHME: Missing reset support for brn58839
  FINISHME: Missing support for brn62269
  FINISHME: Devices without tpu_border_colour_enhanced require entries
            for compressed formats to be stored in the table
            pre-compressed.

The vulkaninfo process then remained in uninterruptible sleep:

  PID   STAT  WCHAN             COMMAND
  3244  Dl+   synchronize_srcu  vulkaninfo --summary

It could not be terminated normally while in that state, and a reboot
was required.

However, the clean-boot log shows that "GPU device lost" occurs even
without starting vulkaninfo manually. The vulkaninfo hang may therefore
be a consequence of the GPU already being in the lost state, rather than
the original cause of the failure.

At this point, the following parts appear to work:

  - MT8173 GPU device-tree node probing
  - MFGTOP clock registration
  - PowerVR kernel module probing
  - Firmware loading
  - Firmware version reporting
  - DRM device initialization
  - Creation of card1 and renderD128

The remaining problem is that the GPU becomes lost approximately six
seconds after initialization.

Could this be related to an interrupt not being delivered, firmware
heartbeat handling, reset sequencing, runtime PM, a missing regulator
consumer relationship, or another MT8173-specific power-domain
requirement?

Please let me know which additional kernel debug options, DRM debug
settings, tracepoints, interrupt statistics, register dumps, or test
patches would be useful. I have physical access to the device and can
build and test further kernel changes.

Thank you for working on MT8173 support.

Best regards,
YoungJoon Lee
