firmware: imx: adds miscdev

This commit introduces the character driver and ABI for communicating with
NXP secure enclaves (like EdgeLock). It includes shared memory management,
message header validation, and command/response processing.

[Severity: High]
Does this code prevent firmware from reading outside the shared memory wind=
ow
when the command lacks an explicit buffer size?

For commands like ELE_OEM_AUTH_CONTAINER_REQ that use SE_CMD_ADDR_NO_SIZE
with no buf_size, only the start address is checked against the bounds. If a
caller provides a start address at the very end of the window (e.g., end - =
1),
could the firmware read the payload out-of-bounds into adjacent physical
memory?

[Severity: High]
Can a concurrent fatal signal and driver unbind bypass the firmware-busy
circuit breaker here?

If a process blocking in ele_msg_rcv() receives a fatal signal at the exact
moment se_if_probe_cleanup() executes and calls complete_all(), the wait
completes. The signal path wakes up, and completion_done() evaluates to tru=
e.
This causes the signal path to skip calling se_mark_fw_busy().

Could this lead to teardown freeing the DMA buffer via
cleanup_se_shared_mem(..., true) while the firmware is still busy and writi=
ng
into the freed memory?

[Severity: High]
Does this silently ignore a registration failure and leave the state out of
sync?

If process A already opened a storage session and is the command receiver, =
and
process B calls ELE_STORAGE_OPEN_REQ, set_dev_ctx_as_command_receiver() will
return -EBUSY. However, the error is only logged, and dev_ctx->strg_hdl rem=
ains
set.

Could this trick the firmware into sending NVM callbacks for process B's
storage session that then get routed to process A?

[Severity: High]
Can concurrent operations cause a race condition when storing transaction
sizes in these global static arrays?

If two callers concurrently trigger ELE_STORAGE_MASTER_EXPORT_REQ,
fw_api_specific_ops() calls ele_set_sz_in_field_addr() which mutates the
shared global array ele_storage_master_export_addr_fields without
synchronization.

If a context requiring a large buffer is overwritten by a context supplying=
 a
small size, could se_val_cmd_addrs() use the clobbered small size, pass the
bounds check, and allow the firmware to write the large export out-of-bound=
s?

[Severity: Medium]
Does a short rx_buf_sz from userspace bypass handle recording and cause a
resource leak?

If a caller issues ELE_SESSION_OPEN_REQ but specifies an artificially small
rx_buf_sz (e.g., 4 bytes), se_val_rsp_hdr_n_status() will return -EINVAL
because the returned buffer size is smaller than the firmware's header leng=
th.

Because rsp_status_err is set, the call to fw_api_specific_ops() is skipped.
Will the successfully allocated handle be permanently leaked since it is
never recorded in dev_ctx->sess_hdl for teardown?

[Severity: High]
Can this sequence read uninitialized stack memory if the user provides a sh=
ort
length?

If a user acting as the command receiver calls read() with a short length
(e.g., 4 bytes), se_if_fops_read() copies only 4 bytes into the 256-byte st=
ack
array rx_msg_snap.

It then unconditionally calls fw_api_specific_ops() with this partially
uninitialized buffer. If the command is ELE_STORAGE_MASTER_EXPORT_REQ,
fw_api_specific_ops() reads rx_msg->data[1], which now contains garbage sta=
ck
memory. Could this update the expected buffer size with an invalid value and
break DMA bounds checking?
