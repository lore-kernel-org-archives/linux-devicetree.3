If the only purpose for the parent node is to group the child nodes 
together, I think it's maybe better to do it without the parent node. 
The DT media graph already connects all the nodes, so just finding a 
single node in the pipeline via compatible allows you to find the rest, 
thus creating the group at runtime.

Although "finding a single node" can be difficult too, if the user uses 
his own IPs.

However, there is at least one thing the above doesn't solve: say, we 
have two independent pipelines. Should they be considered as a single 
"display subsystem" with two pipelines (thus, on Linux side, under a 
single DRM device), or separate display subsystems, thus two DRM devices.

There could be a xlnx property to help define the above, or perhaps the 
aliases node could be used to define the order and number of display 
subsystems. These would also help solving the problem of finding a 
display pipeline when using custom IPs.

Another question is that some of the IPs can also exist on the V4L2 side 
(I guess in theory all of them could be used on V4L2 side, but in 
practice that's perhaps rare). This is the old, unsolved, problem.
