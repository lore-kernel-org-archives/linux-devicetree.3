--- Patch [2]: [PATCH v8 2/2] drm/bridge: Add Lontium LT9611C(EX/UXD) MIPI =
DSI to HDMI driver ---
commit d9ec2b705d140567b617d8df2b85d294039b2f5c

drm/bridge: Add Lontium LT9611C(EX/UXD) MIPI DSI to HDMI driver

This commit adds a DRM bridge driver for the Lontium LT9611C,
LT9611EX, and LT9611UXD DSI to HDMI chips. It supports single or
dual MIPI DSI and I2S/SPDIF audio input to HDMI output. The driver
handles firmware loading, hot plug detection, and video/audio
configuration.

[Severity: Medium]
Is there a missing dependency on I2C here?

Since this config selects REGMAP_I2C, if I2C is disabled, this could
violate Kconfig dependency rules and trigger an unmet direct dependencies
warning, causing build failures for the I2C subsystem functions.

[Severity: Medium]
What happens if this regmap_read() fails?

If the I2C read drops a packet, the status variable will retain its
previous value (which is 0 in the caller's initialization).

This would cause the erase loop condition in lt9611c_block_erase():
    if ((flash_status & 0x01) =3D=3D 0)
to evaluate to true immediately, potentially breaking the firmware
erase and upgrade logic.

[Severity: Medium]
Should the return value of regmap_read() be checked here?

If the I2C read drops a packet, crc_result will contain uninitialized
memory when it is compared against fw_crc.

This could lead to a false success or failure of the upgrade check.

[Severity: Medium]
Will this cause permanent probe failures if the root filesystem is delayed?

When fw_version is 0, this calls request_firmware() synchronously from
lt9611c_probe(). If the firmware is not built-in and rootfs isn't
mounted yet, it fails with -ENOENT.

By propagating this error through dev_err_probe() rather than returning
-EPROBE_DEFER, the driver will fail permanently.

[Severity: Medium]
Is it safe to call request_firmware() while holding the ocm_lock?

This function is also called synchronously from lt9611c_firmware_store()
with the hardware-protecting ocm_lock held.

If the firmware file is missing, the firmware helper can block for up to
60 seconds. Holding the lock during this time will stall the device's
IRQ handler and any DRM atomic operations that need it.

[Severity: High]
Could this clear sequence suppress other pending interrupts?

This writes the inverted bitmask to the clear register. If irq_status
indicates other interrupts are pending (such as bit 1), this will write
a 1 for bit 1.

Since no corresponding 0 is ever written to complete the pulse for bit 1,
its clear signal might be asserted indefinitely. This could either
improperly acknowledge it or permanently suppress it.

[Severity: Critical]
Does this sequence result in a recursive locking deadlock?

In lt9611c_hdmi_audio_prepare(), guard(mutex)(&lt9611c->ocm_lock)
is acquired. While holding this lock, it calls
drm_atomic_helper_connector_hdmi_update_audio_infoframe().

That helper packs the infoframe and calls the connector's write_infoframe
hook, which routes back to lt9611c_hdmi_write_audio_infoframe().

This callback also attempts to acquire lt9611c->ocm_lock using
guard(mutex), leading to a self-deadlock since mutexes are not recursive.

[Severity: Low]
Should the cached firmware version be updated here?

If the firmware upgrade via sysfs succeeds, lt9611c->fw_version is
never updated.

Subsequent reads of the sysfs file will display the old version until
the device is rebound or the system is rebooted.

[Severity: Medium]
Should the return value of devm_drm_bridge_add() be checked?

If the devres allocation fails, it will return an error, but the
driver ignores it and continues probing. This could lead to a
silent display pipeline failure.

[Severity: High]
Could this early bridge registration cause a use-after-free?

The bridge is registered globally here before the primary and
secondary MIPI DSI interfaces are attached.

> +	if (IS_ERR(lt9611c->dsi0)) {
> +		ret =3D PTR_ERR(lt9611c->dsi0);
> +		goto err_remove_bridge;
> +	}

If lt9611c_attach_dsi() fails, the probe function errors out. However,
the bridge relies on devres to unregister it.

During this window, another display controller could discover and attach
to the visible bridge, retaining a pointer to the structure that devres
will soon free.

[Severity: High]
Does this manual teardown conflict with the devm-managed bridge?

The bridge is registered with devm_drm_bridge_add(), so it is only
unregistered by devres after remove() returns. However, this function
manually calls cancel_work_sync() and regulator_bulk_disable().

If the DRM core calls .hpd_enable between remove() returning and
devres cleanup, the driver will call schedule_work() on the cancelled
workqueue.

This could cause a use-after-free when devres finally cleans up the
bridge context.

[Severity: Medium]
What happens if regulator_bulk_disable() fails here?

If it fails, the function returns an error without reversing the
preceding state changes, such as disabling the IRQ and asserting the
reset GPIO.

The PM core will abort the suspend but won't call the resume callback
for this device, leaving it completely unresponsive.

[Severity: High]
Should the IRQ be enabled after the hardware reset is complete?

This calls enable_irq() immediately before lt9611c_reset(). During
the 400+ ms reset sequence, the chip is held in reset and I2C is
unresponsive.

If an interrupt triggers (e.g. from power-up glitches or toggling the
reset pin), the handler will fire and try to read the status register
via I2C while the hardware is still booting, leading to bus timeouts
or lockups.
