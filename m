Author: Jiaxing Hu <gahing@gahingwoo.com>

accel/rocket: add RK3576 NPU (RKNN) support

The RK3576 carries the same RKNN block as the RK3588, with two cores
instead of three and a few platform differences: The patch adds RK3576
support, managing its separate clock domains, power domains, and polling
the completion interrupt via an hrtimer.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does rocket_device_init() expose the
DRM device to userspace before the hardware is actually ready?

It looks like drm_dev_register() is called here, exposing the device,
but rocket_probe() only initializes the core hardware and schedulers via
rocket_core_init() afterward. Could userspace race to open the device and
submit jobs before the schedulers and memory maps are initialized?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does the core removal logic in
rocket_remove() corrupt the device state if a non-terminal core is unbound?

If rocket_remove() is called for core 0 on a 2-core setup, it blindly
decrements rdev->num_cores to 1. If another core is then bound,
rocket_probe() will use rdev->num_cores (1) as the index, overwriting the
active rdev->cores[1] structure currently in use.

[Severity: High]
Can the hardware reset logic race with this polling timer and workqueue?

When a job times out, the DRM scheduler calls rocket_reset(), which
triggers rocket_core_reset() without first stopping the active poll timer
or work. If the timer fires or the work executes concurrently, will they
attempt to read or write MMIO registers on a device undergoing reset or
without active clocks?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does calling iommu_group_get() here leak=
=20
the IOMMU group reference?

It appears iommu_group_get() acquires a reference that is passed to
iommu_detach_group(), but iommu_detach_group() does not consume the
reference, and there is no matching iommu_group_put(). Will this cause the
reference count to overflow or permanently pin IOMMU resources?

[Severity: High]
Does returning early here on poll_dying cause a resource leak and deadlock?

If poll_work_fn() returns early without calling rocket_job_next_locked(), it
looks like the done_fence of the currently executing job is never signaled,
the PM runtime reference is never released, and the IOMMU group is never
detached.

[Severity: High]
Can this sequence check incorrectly pass if the last task of a job completes
via a shared IRQ?

If rocket_job_handle_irq() finishes the last task, it drops the PM runtime
reference and clears in_flight_job. However, because rocket_job_hw_submit()
isn't called, poll_seq is not updated.

When this work function subsequently runs, it passes the sequence check
(poll_work_seq =3D=3D poll_seq) and proceeds to write to hardware. Since the
PM reference was already dropped, could this cause a fatal unclocked MMIO
access?

[Severity: High]
Can this hardware write outside the job_lock race with task submission?

The rocket_job_handle_irq() function writes 0 to OPERATION_ENABLE before
acquiring the job_lock. If poll_work_fn() is concurrently inside the lock
submitting the next task (which sets OPERATION_ENABLE to 1), the IRQ handler
can immediately overwrite it to 0, disabling the new task.

The IRQ handler would then acquire job_lock and call rocket_job_next_locked=
(),
which retires the newly started task without it ever executing.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does the shared IRQ handler perform
unclocked MMIO access?

The rocket_job_irq_handler (which calls rocket_job_handle_irq) is registered
with IRQF_SHARED. If it reads INTERRUPT_RAW_STATUS immediately without
checking if the device's power domain and clocks are active, a shared
interrupt firing while the NPU is runtime suspended could cause a
synchronous external abort.

[Severity: High]
Can a late hardware interrupt re-arm the polling timer after teardown?

While hrtimer_cancel() is called here, the hardware IRQ is not disabled.
If an interrupt fires after this point, rocket_job_handle_irq() will execut=
e,
progress the job, and call rocket_job_hw_submit(), which re-arms the timer
via hrtimer_start().

Once the rocket_core structure is freed, could the armed timer fire and
access freed memory?

>  }

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but can the reset workqueue be used after it
is destroyed?

Because the shared IRQ remains active until devres cleans it up after
rocket_remove(), a late interrupt hitting the MAC interrupt condition could
call queue_work() on this destroyed workqueue, leading to a kernel panic.
