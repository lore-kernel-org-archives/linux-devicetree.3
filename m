Hi Krzysztof,

You are right, and sorry for the noise. I have stopped sending. Nothing is
queued, and I will not repost the three CAN bindings unless you ask me to.

What I got wrong, and what is fixed before anything goes out again:

1. Threading. I attached new versions to older threads and unrelated
   patchsets. That is exactly what submitting-patches.rst warns about: it
   buried the patches and made Patchwork show several versions of one file.
   The next posting is one series, in its own thread, one version only.

2. spi-peripheral-props. Dropped, as you asked. The binding now references
   only can-controller.yaml, and dt_binding_check passes.

3. clock-frequency. Dropped, and clocks stays required. You were right that
   it is ACPI-only; I had argued from the driver code instead of reading the
   git history.

4. Commit messages rewritten as short declarative sentences that describe
   only what changed in the binding.

5. One thing I should have said from the start: these patches were prepared
   with an LLM coding assistant. Per
   Documentation/process/coding-assistants.rst they need an
   "Assisted-by: LLM" tag, and mine did not carry one. It is now on every
   patch. You told me not to paste LLM text, and I should also have
   disclosed that the text was LLM-assisted. Not doing that was the worst
   part of this, not the wording.

The bindings are otherwise unchanged. holt, mpc5xxx-mscan and ifi,canfd are
ready as a single clean v7 series. Tell me when you want it and I will post
it in one new thread.

Thanks for the pointers.

Quchaosheng
