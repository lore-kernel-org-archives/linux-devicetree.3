Thank you for your contribution! Sashiko AI review found 5 potential issue(=

- [Critical] DMA Use-After-Free: buffers are freed on timeout while the fir=
mware may still be executing and writing to them, leading to silent memory =
corruption.
- [High] Returning -ERESTARTSYS after a hardware transaction has successful=
ly completed causes non-idempotent commands to be re-executed and drops the=

- [High] The `fw_busy` circuit breaker is bypassed when `ele_msg_rcv` times=
 out via the `time_after_eq` check, leading to protocol desynchronization.
- [High] Data race in `ele_msg_send_rcv()` when setting up `rx_msg` allows =
spurious firmware responses to corrupt state and desynchronize the protocol.
- [Medium] `ele_get_info()` uses `gen_pool_dma_alloc()` to allocate an SRAM=

--- Patch [3]: [PATCH v30 3/7] firmware: imx: add driver for NXP EdgeLock E=
nclave ---
commit e6e24144537ee5a010fb1fa57fe8270006013954
Author: Pankaj Gupta <pankaj.gupta@nxp.com>
Subject: firmware: imx: add driver for NXP EdgeLock Enclave

This commit adds a MU-based communication interface for the NXP EdgeLock
secure enclave. The driver supports communication with the secure enclave
firmware over messaging units on SoCs like i.MX8ULP and i.MX93.

Closes: https://sashiko.dev/#/patchset/20260721-imx-se-if-v29-0-04a362f4fcc=
a@nxp.com?part=3D3

[Severity: High]
Is this understanding of -ERESTARTSYS accurate?

Returning -ERESTARTSYS to userspace after a hardware transaction has
successfully completed causes the kernel's architecture-specific signal
handling to automatically restart the system call. This transparently forces
the userspace application to re-execute the exact same command.

For non-idempotent operations, won't the hardware execute the command twice,
discarding the successful result of the first execution?

[Severity: Critical]
Is there a risk of a DMA use-after-free here?

If ele_msg_send_rcv() times out, this cleanup function is called immediately
to free the DMA buffer. However, the unresponsive hardware is not reset and
might still complete the operation slightly later, performing a DMA write to
the freed physical address.

Can this corrupt unrelated kernel memory or cause an IOMMU fault if the
memory has been reallocated to another subsystem?

[Severity: Medium]
Does this allocation need to be zero-initialized?

Memory allocated from an SRAM pool via gen_pool_dma_alloc() is not
guaranteed to be zeroed. If the firmware returns a success status but only
partially writes the ele_dev_info structure, the subsequent memcpy() will
copy the uninitialized SRAM contents into s_info:

	memcpy(s_info, get_info_data, sizeof(*s_info));

Could this leak sensitive data from previous hardware operations to
userspace when these fields are exposed?

[Severity: High]
Are we bypassing the fw_busy circuit breaker here?

When a signal interrupts the wait, the loop iterates again. If the deadline
has already passed, this path breaks out of the loop and returns -ETIMEDOUT
without executing the block below that sets atomic_set(&priv->fw_busy, 1).

If the circuit breaker is not tripped, will the driver incorrectly allow new
commands to be sent while the firmware is still processing the old one,
potentially copying a late response into the buffer of the new command?

[Severity: High]
Is there a data race when setting up these variables locklessly?

The commit message notes that the read side in se_if_rx_callback() was moved
inside the clbk_rx_lock. However, if the write side here is lockless, the
compiler or CPU can reorder these updates.

If a concurrent or delayed hardware interrupt triggers se_if_rx_callback(),
could it acquire the lock and observe a non-NULL rx_msg with a stale
rx_msg_sz of 0 from a previous transaction's cleanup? This would cause the
interrupt handler to copy 0 bytes and call complete(), leading the kernel to
process an unwritten buffer.

[Severity: High]
Does discarding a successful hardware response and returning -ERESTARTSYS
here cause unintended re-execution?

As noted regarding the commit message, the kernel will automatically restart
the system call when returning to userspace. If the hardware successfully
completed a non-idempotent operation, won't this discard the result and
force the system call to be re-executed?
