I'm just about to send version 3 of this series (and
then a new reset series derived from the code that was
previously combined with the clock code).  Some things
related to what you mention have changed.  I show that
below, but also respond to your other comments, and try
to advocate for the approach used.

What I have now (about to send) looks like this:

     syscon@0 {
         compatible = "syscon", "simple-mfd";
         reg = <0x0 0x2000>;

         clock {
             compatible = "toshiba,tc9564-clock";
             #clock-cells = <1>;
         };
     };

A reset node will also go inside the syscon, so there is another
function for that MFD.

The regmap belongs to the parent, and is looked up this way:

     regmap = syscon_node_to_regmap(dev_of_node(dev->parent));

I was explaining that the clock input gets split into a number
of "output" clocks derived from that one input.  However you're
right, almost all of these clocks are connected to blocks
internal to the SoC.  There is only one 25 MHz clock that is
exposed externally (CLOCK_REFCLKO).

I think your point (or one of them) is that, even if pci-ep-bus
is used, the only things that warrant being described with
devicetree are those that can affect things outside the chip.
Everything else is not really variable from the perspective of
the platform, and inner details can be determined (and controlled)
by software.


Our original version of this code incorporated clock and reset
control inside the networking driver.  Rob commented that the
DWMAC driver should bind to the PCI functions and "everything
else...should be under the PCIe switch upstream node in a
pci-ep.bus".

The only driver associated with the switch inside the TC9564
is the special power control driver, accessed via I2C.  The
PCI switch functionality is otherwise provided without any
special handling, or is handled by generic code.

What *is* available is the PCI endpoint functions and their
BARs, so the endpoint buses use those.

PCI endpoint bus makes available things that devicetree
does that are very useful (including a standard way of
describing connections between blocks in the SoC).


I know that doesn't address the "exposed clocks" issue,
but it provides some background on why things were done
the way they were.


The single exposed clock *might* justify presenting the
clock controller device in devicetree.  There are also
resets exposed externally via GPIOs, and these control
external entities (PHYs).

But I'll reiterate how *nice* it is to use devicetree to
model the inner structure and of this SoC and the connections
between its various parts.  The DWMAC device driver can use
standard Linux clock (and reset, etc.) interfaces to manage
them--as if they were provided externally, or as if they
*could* be provided by something outside the TC9564.

There was no need to implement "unrelated" clock driver code
inside the DWMAC driver.  Granted, enabling/disabling the
clocks amounts to trivial register updates.  But supporting
two separate PCI functions that share access to those clocks
requires adding reference counting logic for every clock,
and it's just a lot nicer to benefit from the core Linux
code that already does that very well.


This is part of why I asked about the use of devicetree
overlays.  Can devicetree be used to describe an SoC (as
if it were an attached board)?  Would separating the DTS
portion into an overlay make this more palatable?


(Is this what the RPi RP1 does?)

You're right, it's unused in the example.  I'll remove this.

OK.  I'm still going to send version 3 shortly.
