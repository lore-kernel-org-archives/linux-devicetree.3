RK3568 has a native LVDS transmitter that mainline does not support:
rockchip_lvds.c only binds rk3288 and px30. This series adds it.

The transmitter has no register block of its own. It is programmed
entirely through the GRF and re-uses the MIPI DSI0 D-PHY in
PHY_MODE_LVDS, which phy-rockchip-inno-dsidphy already supports. So the
DT node takes the same shape as px30: reg-less, no clock of its own,
just a phy reference, a GRF handle and a power domain. Nothing in the
LVDS path is clocked from the DSI controller's APB clock - the vendor
BSP scans out with PCLK_DSITX_0's gate off - so the driver claims no
clock either.

Patch 1 is an independent fix: rockchip_lvds_encoder_atomic_check()
never copied the connector's bus_flags into the CRTC state, so a panel's
pixelclk-active could not reach the hardware at all. It is a no-op for
the SoCs supported today - rk3288 and px30 pair with the VOP1 driver,
which never reads bus_flags; only VOP2 consumes it - and becomes live
with patch 3.

Patches 2-4 add the binding, the driver and the SoC DT node. No existing
code paths are modified: patch 3 only adds rk3568 functions, and every
rk3288/px30 function is left byte-identical.

The driver work is based on Alibek Omarov's 2023 posting [1], which was
never merged. The changes on top of it are described in patch 3's
changelog. The important one: phy_power_on() must be called from the
encoder enable path, not from probe. Called at probe it runs the phy's
LVDS bring-up - PLL power-on, settle, mode select, serializer reset
pulse, lane enables - while the GRF has not yet switched the block to
LVDS mode and the VOP is not driving dclk. The serializer is clocked
from dclk and latches dead coming out of that reset. The failure mode is
nasty: every register in the phy, the GRF and the VOP reads back
byte-identical to a working system while the lanes sit at common mode
and never toggle.

Not covered: LVDS1 / dual-channel. I have no hardware for it, so only
LVDS0 is wired up.

One integration note for anyone using this: VOP2 spreads its windows
only over video ports that have a connected endpoint, and writes
cumulative layer boundaries into OVL_PORT_SEL. If LVDS is put on vp2
while vp1 has no endpoint, the boundaries come out non-monotonic
(PORT0=2, PORT1=8, PORT2=5) and no window ever reaches vp2. Putting LVDS
on vp1 avoids it. That looks like a separate VOP2 bug and is not
addressed here.

Changes in v2:
  - Drop the clock. The block has no register space of its own, so the
    DSI controller's APB clock never reaches it; the vendor BSP scans
    out LVDS with PCLK_DSITX_0 gated off. The binding, the driver and
    the DT node no longer carry a clock. rk3568 now takes the same
    shape as px30. (patches 2, 3, 4)
  - Merge the GRF programming into rk3568_lvds_poweron(): one masked
    write to VO_CON2 instead of two, and check the output type before
    resuming runtime PM. (patch 3)
  - Balance the enable/disable teardown so a .enable() that fails
    partway does not leave the phy power count or the runtime-PM count
    to underflow when the atomic helpers then call .disable(). (patch 3)
  - Drop the in-code comments that restated phy_set_mode() internals or
    the write-masked GRF convention; the phy-ordering rationale stays in
    patch 3's changelog. (patch 3)
  - Cover letter: drop an incorrect reference to a "VO_CON3" register;
    that name is not in the RK3568 TRM.

Testing
-------

Boot-tested on 7.1.3, with this series as posted, on two RK3568 boards:

  - MYIR MYD-LR3568X eval board, 1024x600 LVDS panel at 59.4 MHz
  - Kanardia Nesis V (custom board, MYIR MY3568 SOM), 1280x800 at 72 MHz

Both light up and scan out correctly; VOP2 reports the programmed mode
with real_clk matching the requested pixel clock exactly.

What has *not* been tested:

  - Patch 1 has not been tested on rk3288 or px30 hardware. The argument
    that it cannot regress them is by inspection - VOP1 has no reader of
    bus_flags - not by measurement. Review of that claim is welcome.
  - Dual-channel/LVDS1 is untested (not implemented).
  - Suspend/resume and DPMS cycling are untested. The P2S_EN re-assert
    in patch 3 is what should make a second enable work; it is reasoned
    from the poweroff path clearing it, not from a measured DPMS cycle.

dt_binding_check passes on patch 2. dtbs_check on the board DTB reports
no issues against the new lvds schema. checkpatch --strict is clean on
patches 1, 2 and 4; on patch 3 it emits only two false positives - the
lore URL in the changelog exceeds 75 chars, and a "should normally be
const" on the rk3568 encoder helper funcs, which are const (the wrap
splits "static const" onto its own line, matching the rk3288/px30
entries above them).

Tooling disclosure
------------------

Per Documentation/process/coding-assistants.rst and
generated-content.rst: this series was produced with the help of Claude
(claude-opus-4-8), used interactively across a long debugging session
rather than from a single prompt. The assistant read the vendor BSP
driver and the phy/VOP2 sources, identified the phy-ordering bug that
patch 3 fixes, and wrote the patch text and changelogs. All hardware
testing, every oscilloscope measurement and register dump, and the two
decisive debugging ideas - diffing register state against a working
vendor board, and using MIPI DSI on the shared D-PHY to prove the lanes
were good - were mine. I have reviewed every line and can defend it.
The Signed-off-by is mine alone.

No coccinelle/sparse/smatch runs were involved.
