--- Patch [5]: [PATCH v32 5/7] firmware: imx: adds miscdev ---
commit b46f4f0d3fc0745184ba130cd15fbe6c57e10cbe
Author: Pankaj Gupta <pankaj.gupta@nxp.com>
Subject: firmware: imx: adds miscdev

This commit adds a misc character driver to communicate with NXP secure=20
enclave hardware. It enables userspace applications to exchange messages=20
with the enclave using an ioctl-based API, handling shared memory managemen=
t=20
and payload verification.

[Severity: High]
Could this lead to a TOCTOU race and a lost wakeup during unbind?

In ele_msg_send_rcv(), atomic_read(&priv->going_away) is checked locklessly=
=20
before calling reinit_completion(). Concurrently, se_if_probe_cleanup()=20
sets going_away to 1 and calls complete_all() to forcefully wake any waiter=
s:

se_if_probe_cleanup() {
    atomic_set(&priv->going_away, 1);
    ...
    complete_all(&priv->waiting_rsp_clbk_hdl.done);
}

Since se_if_probe_cleanup() does not acquire se_if_cmd_lock, it can execute
immediately after ele_msg_send_rcv() checks going_away. The reinit_completi=
on()
call here would then overwrite the forced wakeup. This leaves ele_msg_rcv()
waiting indefinitely, which can cause the device unbind process to hang.

[Severity: High]
Can this error path trigger a NULL pointer dereference?

If kasprintf() fails to allocate memory for dev_ctx->devname earlier in
init_misc_device_context(), the code jumps to the exit label. At this point=
,=20
dev_ctx->priv has not yet been assigned and is NULL.

This error path calls cleanup_se_shared_mem(dev_ctx, true), which does:

cleanup_se_shared_mem() {
    struct se_if_priv *priv =3D dev_ctx->priv;
    ...
    if (priv->mem_pool)
        ...
}

This will unconditionally dereference the uninitialized priv pointer,
causing an immediate kernel panic.

[Severity: High]
Is it safe to discard a successful firmware response when a signal is pendi=
ng?

If a successful firmware transaction was interrupted by a signal, the lower
layers might overwrite the success return code with -ERESTARTSYS (which is
translated to -EINTR here). When this happens, the successful response payl=
oad
is discarded in se_ioctl_cmd_snd_rcv_cleanup().

Because the kernel successfully retrieved the response and the firmware has
committed the action, returning -EINTR breaks idempotency for state-mutating
commands. Userspace receives -EINTR and might unsafely retry commands that
were actually successfully executed by the firmware. Should the kernel retu=
rn
the successful response to userspace instead?

[Severity: High]
Should this return -ERESTARTSYS instead of -EBUSY when interrupted?

When the interruptible lock acquisition fails due to a pending signal,
masking the error with -EBUSY breaks the standard POSIX syscall restart
mechanism. Userspace receives a hard error (EBUSY) instead of an
interrupt (EINTR), which prevents applications from properly handling
signals or transparently retrying the syscall.

[Severity: High]
Does this risk permanently stranding the message if a signal arrives?

In se_if_fops_read(), the driver blocks in ele_msg_rcv() waiting for a
message from the firmware. When a message arrives, the completion is
consumed and the message is staged in the driver's internal buffer.

The driver then attempts to reacquire the fops_lock here using an
interruptible primitive. If a signal is pending at this exact moment, the
lock acquisition fails and returns -ERESTARTSYS.

Because the completion has already been consumed, the message is left
stranded in the buffer. When userspace retries the read() syscall, it will
block on ele_msg_rcv() again waiting for a new completion. Because the
firmware protocol is half-duplex, it will wait for userspace to process
the already delivered message, causing a permanent deadlock.

[Severity: High]
Could this lead to a Use-After-Free if a concurrent open races with device
teardown?

During device unbind, se_if_probe_cleanup() calls misc_deregister(). While
misc_deregister() removes the device from the active misc device list, it
does not prevent a racing VFS open (which already found the miscdev but was
preempted before calling fops->open) from continuing.

If unbind completes, se_if_priv_release() drops the final reference to the
open_gate structure, freeing it. When the delayed open call resumes here,
it calculates the gate pointer using container_of() and calls
se_if_open_gate_get(gate). This reads from the freed gate->refcount,
causing a Use-After-Free.

[Severity: High]
Is there a limit on how much DMA memory can be allocated through this open
path?

When a user process opens the device file, se_if_fops_open() invokes
init_device_context(), which calls init_se_shared_mem(). This unconditional=
ly
allocates 128KB (MAX_DATA_SIZE_PER_USER) of DMA coherent memory using
dma_alloc_coherent() per device context.

Since there is no global limit on the number of dev_ctx instances, a single
process could rapidly open the device repeatedly. This could instantly cons=
ume
hundreds of megabytes of contiguous DMA memory, which can exhaust the pool
and prevent other drivers from functioning, leading to a Denial of Service.

[Severity: High]
Does this structure introduce an ABI mismatch between 32-bit userspace and
a 64-bit kernel?

The se_ioctl_cmd_snd_rcv_rsp_info struct places a __u64 immediately after
a __u32. On 64-bit architectures, this induces 4 bytes of padding before
the __u64 and at the end of the struct, resulting in a 32-byte struct. On
some 32-bit architectures, __u64 requires only 4-byte alignment, producing
a 24-byte struct.

Because the SE_IOCTL_CMD_SEND_RCV_RSP macro incorporates the struct's size,
the generated IOCTL number will differ between a 32-bit application and the
64-bit kernel. When compat_ptr_ioctl passes the 32-bit IOCTL command to
se_ioctl(), it will fail to match the 64-bit switch case, causing a -ENOTTY
error for 32-bit compat userspace applications.
