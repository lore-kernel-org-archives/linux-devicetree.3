I don't think we should use Allwinner as a precedent for this.
Allwinner's use case was that we needed a device created with a handle
to the video pipeline to back the main DRM device. This was about 10y
ago, and looking back we could have done about the same work by
registering a device at module init and searching the DT for enabled
compatibles.

I'd suggest you to go that route if you have any driver you can plumb it
into, like an FPGA manager or something.
